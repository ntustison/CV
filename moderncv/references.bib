	abstract = {PURPOSE: The prognosis of lower grade glioma (LGG) patients depends (in large part) on both isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation and chromosome 1p/19q codeletion status. IDH-mutant LGG without 1p/19q codeletion (IDHmut-Noncodel) often exhibit a unique imaging appearance that includes high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values not observed in other subtypes. The purpose of this study was to develop an ADC analysis-based approach that can automatically identify IDHmut-Noncodel LGG.
METHODS: Whole-tumor ADC metrics, including fractional tumor volume with ADC > 1.5 × 10-3mm2/s (VADC>1.5), were used to identify IDHmut-Noncodel LGG in a cohort of N = 134 patients. Optimal threshold values determined in this dataset were then validated using an external dataset containing N = 93 cases collected from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Classifications were also compared with radiologist-identified T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and evaluated concurrently to identify added value from a combined approach.
RESULTS: VADC>1.5 classified IDHmut-Noncodel LGG in the internal cohort with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80. An optimal threshold value of 0.35 led to sensitivity/specificity = 0.57/0.93. Classification performance was similar in the validation cohort, with VADC>1.5 ≥ 0.35 achieving sensitivity/specificity = 0.57/0.91 (AUC = 0.81). Across both groups, 37 cases exhibited positive T2-FLAIR mismatch sign-all of which were IDHmut-Noncodel. Of these, 32/37 (86%) also exhibited VADC>1.5 ≥ 0.35, as did 23 additional IDHmut-Noncodel cases which were negative for T2-FLAIR mismatch sign.
CONCLUSION: Tumor subregions with high ADC were a robust indicator of IDHmut-Noncodel LGG, with VADC>1.5 achieving > 90% classification specificity in both internal and validation cohorts. VADC>1.5 exhibited strong concordance with the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and the combination of both parameters improved sensitivity in detecting IDHmut-Noncodel LGG.},

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as "breachers" or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

@article{Gerald-Teague:2021aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperpolarized gas with helium (HHe-3) MR (magnetic resonance) is a noninvasive imaging method which maps and quantifies regions of ventilation heterogeneity (VH) in the lung. VH is an important feature of asthma, but little is known as to how VH informs patient phenotypes.
PURPOSE: To determine if VH indicators quantified by HHe-3 MR imaging (MRI) predict phenotypic characteristics and map to regions of inflammation in children with problematic wheeze or asthma.
METHODS: Sixty children with poorly-controlled wheeze or asthma underwent HHe-3 MRI, including 22 with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The HHe-3 signal intensity defined four ventilation compartments. The non-ventilated and hypoventilated compartments divided by the total lung volume defined a VH index (VHI %).
RESULTS: Children with VHI % in the upper quartile had significantly greater airflow limitation, bronchodilator responsiveness, blood eosinophils, expired nitric oxide (FeNO), and BAL eosinophilic or neutrophilic granulocyte patterns compared to children with VHI % in the lower quartile. Lavage return from hypoventilated bronchial segments had greater eosinophil % than from ventilated segments.
CONCLUSION: In children with asthma, greater VHI % as measured by HHe-3 MRI identifies a severe phenotype with higher type 2 inflammatory markers, and maps to regions of lung eosinophilia. Listed on ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02577497).},

	abstract = {Diverse, high-dimensional modalities collected in large cohorts present new opportunities for the formulation and testing of integrative scientific hypotheses. Similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR) is an algorithm that exploits inter-modality relationships to transform large scientific datasets into smaller, more well-powered and interpretable low-dimensional spaces. SiMLR contributes an objective function for identifying joint signal, regularization based on sparse matrices representing prior within-modality relationships and an implementation that permits application to joint reduction of large data matrices. We demonstrate that SiMLR outperforms closely related methods on supervised learning problems in simulation data, a multi-omics cancer survival prediction dataset and multiple modality neuroimaging datasets. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results in a variety of application domains.},

The base software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

@article{Tustison:2021aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize the differences between histogram-based and image-based algorithms for segmentation of hyperpolarized gas lung images.
METHODS: Four previously published histogram-based segmentation algorithms (ie, linear binning, hierarchical k-means, fuzzy spatial c-means, and a Gaussian mixture model with a Markov random field prior) and an image-based convolutional neural network were used to segment 2 simulated data sets derived from a public (n = 29 subjects) and a retrospective collection (n = 51 subjects) of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas lung images transformed by common MRI artifacts (noise and nonlinear intensity distortion). The resulting ventilation-based segmentations were used to assess algorithmic performance and characterize optimization domain differences in terms of measurement bias and precision.
RESULTS: Although facilitating computational processing and providing discriminating clinically relevant measures of interest, histogram-based segmentation methods discard important contextual spatial information and are consequently less robust in terms of measurement precision in the presence of common MRI artifacts relative to the image-based convolutional neural network.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct optimization within the image domain using convolutional neural networks leverages spatial information, which mitigates problematic issues associated with histogram-based approaches and suggests a preferred future research direction. Further, the entire processing and evaluation framework, including the newly reported deep learning functionality, is available as open source through the well-known Advanced Normalization Tools ecosystem.},

@article{McMakin:2022aa,
	abstract = {This study examines neural mechanisms of negative overgeneralization, the increased likelihood of generalizing negative information, in peri-puberty. Theories suggest that weak pattern separation [overlapping representations are made distinct, indexed by dentate gyrus/ cornu ammonis (CA)3 hippocampal subfield activation] underlies negative overgeneralization. We alternatively propose that neuro-maturational changes that favor pattern completion (cues reinstate stored representations, indexed by CA1 activation) are modulated by circuitry involved in emotional responding [amygdala, medial prefrontal cortices (mPFC)] to drive negative overgeneralization. Youth (n = 34, 9-14 years) recruited from community and clinic settings participated in an emotional mnemonic similarity task while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. At study, participants indicated the valence of images; at test, participants made recognition memory judgments. Critical lure stimuli, which were similar to images at study, were presented at test, and errors ('false alarms') to negative relative to neutral stimuli reflected negative overgeneralization. Negative overgeneralization was related to greater and more similar patterns of activation in CA1 and both dorsal mPFC (dmPFC)and ventral mPFC (vmPFC) for negative relative to neutral stimuli. At study, amygdala exhibited greater functional coupling with CA1 and dmPFC during negative items that were later generalized. Negative overgeneralization is rooted in amygdala and mPFC modulation at encoding and pattern completion at retrieval.},

@article{Song:2022aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in treatments for multiple sclerosis, insidious disease progression remains an area of unmet medical need, for which atrophy-based biomarkers may help better characterize the progressive biology.
METHODS: We developed and applied a method of longitudinal deformation-based morphometry to provide voxel-level assessments of brain volume changes and identified brain regions that were significantly impacted by disease-modifying therapy.
RESULTS: Using brain MRI data from two identically designed pivotal trials of relapsing multiple sclerosis (total N = 1483), we identified multiple deep brain regions, including the thalamus and brainstem, where volume loss over time was reduced by ocrelizumab (p < 0.05), a humanized anti-CD20 + monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, identified brainstem shrinkage, as well as brain ventricle expansion, was associated with a greater risk for confirmed disability progression (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of deep brain structures has a strong implication for developing new biomarkers of brain atrophy reduction to advance drug development for multiple sclerosis, which has an increasing focus on targeting the progressive biology.},

@article{Chen:2022aa,
	abstract = {To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple sites. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between sites, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data by removing site-related effects in the mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of machine learning (ML) in neuroimaging has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that methods for removing site effects in mean and variance may not be sufficient for ML. This stems from the fact that such methods fail to address how correlations between measurements can vary across sites. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is used to show that considerable differences in covariance exist across sites and that popular harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We then propose a novel harmonization method called Correcting Covariance Batch Effects (CovBat) that removes site effects in mean, variance, and covariance. We apply CovBat and show that within-site correlation matrices are successfully harmonized. Furthermore, we find that ML methods are unable to distinguish scanner manufacturer after our proposed harmonization is applied, and that the CovBat-harmonized data retain accurate prediction of disease group.},

	abstract = {A central challenge of medical imaging studies is to extract biomarkers that characterize disease pathology or outcomes. Modern automated approaches have found tremendous success in high-resolution, high-quality magnetic resonance images. These methods, however, may not translate to low-resolution images acquired on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners with lower magnetic field strength. In low-resource settings where low-field scanners are more common and there is a shortage of radiologists to manually interpret MRI scans, it is critical to develop automated methods that can augment or replace manual interpretation, while accommodating reduced image quality. We present a fully automated framework for translating radiological diagnostic criteria into image-based biomarkers, inspired by a project in which children with cerebral malaria (CM) were imaged using low-field 0.35 Tesla MRI. We integrate multiatlas label fusion, which leverages high-resolution images from another sample as prior spatial information, with parametric Gaussian hidden Markov models based on image intensities, to create a robust method for determining ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volume. We also propose normalized image intensity and texture measurements to determine the loss of gray-to-white matter tissue differentiation and sulcal effacement. These integrated biomarkers have excellent classification performance for determining severe brain swelling due to CM.},

	abstract = {White matter hyperintensities are a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are strongly related to cognition in older adults. Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD) = 76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy.

	abstract = {Nuisance variables in medical imaging research are common, complicating association and prediction studies based on image data. Medical image data are typically high dimensional, often consisting of many highly correlated features. As a result, computationally efficient and robust methods to address nuisance variables are difficult to implement. By-region univariate residualization is commonly used to remove the influence of nuisance variables, as are various extensions. However, these methods neglect multivariate properties and may fail to fully remove influence related to the joint distribution of these regions. Some methods, such as functional regression and others, do consider multivariate properties when controlling for nuisance variables. However, the utility of these methods is limited for data with many image regions due to computational and model complexity. We develop a multivariate residualization method to estimate the association between the image and nuisance variable using a machine learning algorithm and then compute the orthogonal projection of each subject's image data onto this space. We illustrate this method's performance in a set of simulation studies and apply it to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).},

	abstract = {Precise focusing is essential for transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) to minimize collateral damage to non-diseased tissues and to achieve temperatures capable of inducing coagulative necrosis at acceptable power deposition levels. CT is usually used for this refocusing but requires a separate study (CT) ahead of the TcMRgFUS procedure. The goal of this study was to determine whether MRI using an appropriate sequence would be a viable alternative to CT for planning ultrasound refocusing in TcMRgFUS. We tested three MRI pulse sequences (3D T1 weighted 3D volume interpolated breath hold examination (VIBE), proton density weighted 3D sampling perfection with applications optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution and 3D true fast imaging with steady state precision T2-weighted imaging) on patients who have already had a CT scan performed. We made detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the MRI data and compared those so-called 'virtual CT' to detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the CT data, used as a reference standard. We then loaded both standard and virtual CT in a TcMRgFUS device and compared the calculated phase correction values, as well as the temperature elevation in a phantom. A series of Bland-Altman measurement agreement analyses showed T1 3D VIBE as the optimal MRI sequence, with respect to minimizing the measurement discrepancy between the MRI derived total skull thickness measurement and the CT derived total skull thickness measurement (mean measurement discrepancy: 0.025; 95% CL (-0.22-0.27); p = 0.825). The T1-weighted sequence was also optimal in estimating skull CT density and skull layer thickness. The mean difference between the phase shifts calculated with the standard CT and the virtual CT reconstructed from the T1 dataset was 0.08 $\pm$ 1.2 rad on patients and 0.1 $\pm$ 0.9 rad on phantom. Compared to the real CT, the MR-based correction showed a 1 $\,^{\circ}$C drop on the maximum temperature elevation in the phantom (7% relative drop). Without any correction, the maximum temperature was down 6 $\,^{\circ}$C (43% relative drop). We have developed an approach that allows for a reconstruction of a virtual CT dataset from MRI to perform phase correction in TcMRgFUS. },

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corticospinal tract (CST) is a reliable surrogate for intraoperative macrostimulation through the deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads. The authors hypothesized that the distance on MRI from the DBS lead to the CST as determined by DTI would correlate with intraoperative motor thresholds from macrostimulations through the same DBS lead.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed pre- and postoperative MRI studies and intraoperative macrostimulation recordings in 17 patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated by DBS stimulation. Preoperative DTI tractography of the CST was coregistered with postoperative MRI studies showing the position of the DBS leads. The shortest distance and the angle from each contact of each DBS lead to the CST was automatically calculated using software-based analysis. The distance measurements calculated for each contact were evaluated with respect to the intraoperative voltage thresholds that elicited a motor response at each contact.
RESULTS: There was a nonsignificant trend for voltage thresholds to increase when the distances between the DBS leads and the CST increased. There was a significant correlation between the angle and the voltage, but the correlation was weak (coefficient of correlation [R] = 0.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Caution needs to be exercised when using DTI tractography information to guide DBS lead placement in patients with PD. Further studies are needed to compare DTI tractography measurements with other approaches such as microelectrode recordings and conventional intraoperative MRI-guided placement of DBS leads.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Rapid regional fluctuations in GABA may result in inhomogeneous concentrations throughout the brain parenchyma. The goal of this study is to provide further insight into the natural distribution of GABA throughout the brain and thus determine if a surrogate site may be used for spectroscopy when evaluating motor diseases, neurological disorders, or psychiatric dysfunction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, eight healthy volunteers underwent spectroscopic evaluation of the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, lateral temporal lobe, basal ganglia, and both hippocampi using a spin echo variant of a J-difference editing method. Knowledge of the relative peak intensities of the macromolecule peaks at 3ppm and 0.9ppm was used to correct the contribution of co-edited macromolecules to the GABA peak at 3ppm. The GABA values were internally referenced to NAA. Linear regression was used to normalize the effect of regional tissue-fraction variation on the GABA/NAA values. A one-way ANOVA was performed with Tukey's multiple comparison test to compare the normalized GABA/NAA values in each pair of locations.
RESULTS: After accounting for the macromolecule contribution to the GABA signal and correction for tissue fraction variation, the normalized GABA/NAA ratios differ significantly between the six brain locations (p<0.001). Pairwise comparisons of the corrected normalized GABA/NAA ratios show statistically significant variation between the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia, frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and frontal lobe and right hippocampus. Variations in the normalized GABA/NAA ratios trend toward significance between the frontal lobe and left hippocampus, occipital lobe and the frontal lobe, occipital lobe and basal ganglia, and occipital lobe and right hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that GABA concentration is inhomogeneous throughout the parenchyma. Studies evaluating the role of GABA must carefully consider voxel placement when incorporating spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).
CONCLUSION: An annotated atlas library approach can be used to provide good lung and lobe estimation in proton MRI. The proposed framework is useful for subsequent anatomically based analysis of structural and/or functional pulmonary image data.

These gaps in evaluating cross-site differences are concerning, especially given the well-established differences that can occur between data acquired on scanners with different manufacturer, hardware or software.
METHODS: This study reports findings on (1) a series of studies utilizing two MR phantoms to interrogate machine-based variability using data collected on the same magnet, (2) a human phantom repeatedly imaged on the same scanner to investigate within-subject, within-site variability and (3) a human phantom imaged on three different scanners to examine within subject, between-site variability.
RESULTS: Although variability is relatively minimal for the phantom scanned on the same magnet, significantly more variability is introduced in a human subject, particularly when regions are relatively small or multiple sites used.
CONCLUSION: Vigilance when combining data from different sites is suggested and that future efforts address these issues.},

METHODS: Part A (single-blind) comprised 4weeks of ivacaftor treatment; Part B (open-label) comprised 48weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in total ventilation defect (TVD; total defect volume:total lung volume ratio).
RESULTS: Mean change in TVD ranged from -8.2% (p=0.0547) to -12.8% (p=0.0078) in Part A (n=8) and -6.3% (p=0.1953) to -9.0% (p=0.0547) in Part B (n=8) as assessed by human reader and computer algorithm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: TVD responded to ivacaftor therapy. 3He-MRI provides an individual quantification of disease burden that may be able to detect aspects of the disease missed by population-based spirometry metrics.

Recent human fMRI studies have identified a functional dissociation within the EC, similar to what is found in rodents. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to identify a specific hypoactivity in the anterolateral EC (alEC) commensurate with major behavioral deficits on an object pattern separation task in asymptomatic older adults. Only subtle deficits were found in a comparable spatial condition, with no associated differences in posteromedial EC between young and older adults. We additionally linked this condition to dentate/CA3 hyperactivity, and the ratio of activity between the regions was associated with object mnemonic discrimination impairment.

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly heterogeneous and not well understood. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe129) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique way to assess important lung functions such as gas uptake. In this pilot study, we exploited multiple imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), gadolinium-enhanced perfusion MRI, and Xe129 MRI, to perform a detailed investigation of changes in lung morphology and functions in COPD. Utility and strengths of Xe129 MRI in assessing COPD were also evaluated against the other imaging modalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four COPD patients and four age-matched normal subjects participated in this study. Lung tissue density measured by CT, perfusion measures from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and ventilation and gas uptake measures from Xe129 MRI were calculated for individual lung lobes to assess regional changes in lung morphology and function, and to investigate correlations among the different imaging modalities.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found for all measures among the five lobes in either the COPD or age-matched normal group. Strong correlations (R > 0.5 or < -0.5, p < 0.001) were found between ventilation and perfusion measures. Also gas uptake by blood as measured by Xe129 MRI showed strong correlations with CT tissue density and ventilation measures (R > 0.5 or < -0.5, p < 0.001) and moderate to strong correlations with perfusion measures (R > 0.4 or < -0.5, p < 0.01). Four distinctive patterns of functional abnormalities were found in patients with COPD.
CONCLUSION: Xe129 MRI has high potential to uniquely identify multiple changes in lung physiology in COPD using a single breath-hold acquisition.},

@article{Tustison:2019ae,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

	abstract = {Using high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study tested the hypothesis that ABCA7 genetic risk differentially affects intra-medial temporal lobe (MTL) functional connectivity between MTL subfields, versus internetwork connectivity of the MTL with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in nondemented older African Americans. Although the association of ABCA7 risk variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been confirmed worldwide, its effect size on the relative odds of being diagnosed with AD is significantly higher in African Americans. However, little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive function in older African Americans and how they relate to AD risk conferred by ABCA7. In a case-control fMRI study of 36 healthy African Americans, we observed ABCA7 related impairments in behavioral generalization that was mediated by dissociation in entorhinal cortex (EC) resting state functional connectivity. Specifically, ABCA7 risk variant was associated with EC-hippocampus hyper-synchronization and EC-mPFC hypo-synchronization. Carriers of the risk genotype also had a significantly smaller anterolateral EC, despite our finding no group differences on standardized neuropsychological tests. Our findings suggest a model where impaired cortical connectivity leads to a more functionally isolated EC at rest, which translates into aberrant EC-hippocampus hyper-synchronization resulting in generalization deficits. While we cannot identify the exact mechanism underlying the observed alterations in EC structure and network function, considering the relevance of Aβ in ABCA7 related AD pathogenesis, the results of our study may reflect the synergistic reinforcement between amyloid and tau pathology in the EC, which significantly increases tau-induced neuronal loss and accelerates synaptic alterations. Finally, our results add to a growing literature suggesting that generalization of learning may be a useful tool for assessing the mild cognitive deficits seen in the earliest phases of prodromal AD, even before the more commonly reported deficits in episodic memory arise.},

We have translated what we have learned in clinical imaging to the very special domain of the mouse brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of perfusion fixed specimens can now be performed with spatial resolution of 45 μm3 , that is, voxels that are 21,000 times smaller than the human connectome protocol. Specimen preparation has been optimized through an active staining protocol using a Gd chelate. Compressed sensing has been integrated into high performance reconstruction and post processing pipelines allowing acquisition of a whole mouse brain connectome in <12 hr. The methods have been validated against retroviral tracer studies. False positive tracts, which are especially problematic in clinical studies, have been reduced substantially to ~28%. The methods have been streamlined to provide high-fidelity, whole mouse brain connectomes as a routine study. The data package provides holistic insight into the mouse brain with anatomic definition at the meso-scale, quantitative volumes of subfields, scalar DTI metrics, and quantitative tractography.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) link full genome data to a handful of traits. However, in neuroimaging studies, there is an almost unlimited number of traits that can be extracted for full image-wide big data analyses. Large populations are needed to achieve the necessary power to detect statistically significant effects, emphasizing the need to pool data across multiple studies. Neuroimaging consortia, e.g., ENIGMA and CHARGE, are now analyzing MRI data from over 30,000 individuals. Distributed processing protocols extract harmonized features at each site, and pool together only the cohort statistics using meta analysis to avoid data sharing. To date, such MRI projects have focused on single measures such as hippocampal volume, yet voxelwise analyses (e.g., tensor-based morphometry; TBM) may help better localize statistical effects. This can lead to $10^{13}$1013 tests for GWAS and become underpowered. We developed an analytical framework for multi-site TBM by performing multi-channel registration to cohort-specific templates. Our results highlight the reliability of the method and the added power over alternative options while preserving single site specificity and opening the doors for well-powered image-wide genome-wide discoveries.},

	abstract = {Preclinical and clinical research indicates that excess corticosteroid is associated with adverse effects on the hippocampus. Animal model data suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists may block corticosteroid effect on the hippocampus. This translational clinical trial investigated the effect of memantine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volume in humans receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Men and women (N = 46) receiving chronic prescription corticosteroid therapy were randomized to memantine or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design (two 24-week treatment periods, separated by a 4-week washout) for 52 weeks. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and after each treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean corticosteroid dose was 7.69 $\pm$ 6.41 mg/day and mean duration 4.90 $\pm$ 5.61 years. Controlling for baseline volumes, the left DG/CA3 region was significantly larger following memantine than placebo (p = .011). The findings suggest that an NMDA receptor antagonist attenuates corticosteroid effect in the same hippocampal subfields in humans as in animal models. This finding has both mechanistic and clinical implications. Attenuation of the effect of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 region implicates the NMDA receptor in human hippocampal volume losses with corticosteroids. In addition, by suggesting a drug class that may, at least in part, block the effects of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 subfield, these results may have clinical relevance for people receiving prescription corticosteroids, as well as to those with cortisol elevations due to medical or psychiatric conditions.},

Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues. We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.},

@article{Nguyen:2019aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids are a class of hormones that include naturally occurring cortisol and corticosterone, as well as prescription drugs commonly used to manage inflammatory, autoimmune, and allergic conditions. Adverse effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, are common. The hippocampus appears to be especially sensitive to the effects of glucocorticoids. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined hippocampal subfields in humans receiving glucocorticoids. We examined patients on chronic glucocorticoid regimens to determine relationships between dose and duration of treatment, and hippocampal subfields, and related regions volumes.
METHODS/PROCEDURES: The study included adult men and women receiving at least 5 mg daily of prednisone equivalents for at least 6 months. Volumes of brain regions were measured via magnetic resonance imaging. A multivariate general linear model was used for analysis, with brain volumes as dependent variables and age, sex, and cumulative corticosteroid exposure, as predictors.
FINDINGS/RESULTS: The study population consisted of 81 adult outpatients (43 male) on corticosteroids (mean dose, 7.88 mg; mean duration, 76.75 months). Cumulative glucocorticoid exposure was negatively associated with left and right hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA3 volume. In subsequent subgroup analysis, this association held true for the age group older than the median age of 46 years but not for the younger age group.
IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: This finding is consistent with previous studies showing detrimental effects of elevated glucocorticoids on the hippocampus but further suggests that the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions are particularly vulnerable to those effects, which is consistent with animal models of chronic stress but has not been previously demonstrated in humans.},

	abstract = {Mechanical stresses on the lung impose the major stimuli for developmental and compensatory lung growth and remodeling. We used computed tomography (CT) to noninvasively characterize the factors influencing lobar mechanical deformation in relation to posture, pneumonectomy (PNX), and exogenous proangiogenic factor supplementation. Post-PNX adult canines received weekly inhalations of nebulized nanoparticles loaded with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) or control (empty nanoparticles) for 16 wk. Supine and prone CT were performed at two transpulmonary pressures pre- and post-PNX following treatment. Lobar air and tissue volumes, fractional tissue volume (FTV), specific compliance (Cs), mechanical strains, and shear distortion were quantified. From supine to prone, lobar volume and Cs increased while strain and shear magnitudes generally decreased. From pre- to post-PNX, air volume increased less and FTV and Cs increased more in the left caudal (LCa) than in other lobes. FTV increased most in the dependent subpleural regions, and the portion of LCa lobe that expanded laterally wrapping around the mediastinum. Supine deformation was nonuniform pre- and post-PNX; strains and shear were most pronounced in LCa lobe and declined when prone. Despite nonuniform regional expansion and deformation, post-PNX lobar mechanics were well preserved compared with pre-PNX because of robust lung growth and remodeling establishing a new mechanical equilibrium. EPO treatment eliminated posture-dependent changes in FTV, accentuated the post-PNX increase in FTV, and reduced FTV heterogeneity without altering absolute air or tissue volumes, consistent with improved microvascular blood volume distribution and modestly enhanced post-PNX alveolar microvascular reserves.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mechanical stresses on the lung impose the major stimuli for lung growth. We used computed tomography to image deformation of the lung in relation to posture, loss of lung units, and inhalational delivery of the growth promoter erythropoietin. Following loss of one lung in adult large animals, the remaining lung expanded and grew while retaining near-normal mechanical properties. Inhalation of erythropoietin promoted more uniform distribution of blood volume within the remaining lung.},

	abstract = {Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas such as peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape of these tumors, segmentation of the sub-regions is challenging. Recent developments using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in various semantic and medical image segmentation tasks, many of which are based on the U-Net network structure with symmetric encoding and decoding paths for end-to-end segmentation due to its high efficiency and good performance. In brain tumor segmentation, the 3D nature of multimodal MRI poses challenges such as memory and computation limitations and class imbalance when directly adopting the U-Net structure. In this study we aim to develop a deep learning model using a 3D U-Net with adaptations in the training and testing strategies, network structures, and model parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Furthermore, instead of picking one best model, an ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyper-parameters are used to reduce random errors from each model and yield improved performance. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and achieved the 9th place in the very competitive 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. In addition, to emphasize the clinical value of the developed segmentation method, a linear model based on the radiomics features extracted from segmentation and other clinical features are developed to predict patient overall survival. Evaluation of these innovations shows high prediction accuracy in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma patients, which achieved the 1st place in the 2018 BraTS challenge.},

	abstract = { Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools for quantifying neurostructural changes. Longitudinal-specific strategies for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power. Using the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) data, comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months, we evaluate the utility of longitudinal FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) surrogate thickness values in the context of a linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling strategy. Specifically, we estimate the residual variability and between-subject variability associated with each processing stream as it is known from the statistical literature that minimizing the former while simultaneously maximizing the latter leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams. Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed ANTs longitudinal framework which provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.},

@article{Durst:2014ab,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gliomas remain difficult to treat, in part, due to our inability to accurately delineate the margins of the tumor. The goal of our study was to evaluate if a combination of advanced MR imaging techniques and a multimodal imaging model could be used to predict tumor infiltration in patients with diffuse gliomas.
METHODS: Institutional review board approval and written consent were obtained. This prospective pilot study enrolled patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy for a suspected de novo glioma. Stereotactic biopsy coordinates were coregistered with multiple standard and advanced neuroimaging sequences in 10 patients. Objective imaging values were assigned to the biopsy sites for each of the imaging sequences. A principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the imaging dataset without losing important information. A univariate analysis was performed to identify the statistically relevant principal components. Finally, a multivariate analysis was used to build the final model describing nuclear density.
RESULTS: A univariate analysis identified three principal components as being linearly associated with the observed nuclear density (p values 0.021, 0.016, and 0.046, respectively). These three principal component composite scores are predominantly comprised of DTI (mean diffusivity or average diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy) and PWI data (rMTT, Ktrans). The p value of the model was <0.001. The correlation between the predicted and observed nuclear density was 0.75.
CONCLUSION: A multi-input, single output imaging model may predict the extent of glioma invasion with significant correlation with histopathology.},

	abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling. },

	abstract = {In this paper we report the set-up and results of the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2012 and 2013 conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human entorhinal cortex (ERC) connects the temporal neocortex with hippocampus and is essential for memory retrieval and navigation. Markedly, there have been only few quantitative MRI works on the ERC geometric measurements in pediatric and adult healthy subjects across the lifespan. Here, we sought to fill this gap in knowledge by quantifying the ERC thickness in a very large cohort of subjects spanning 9 decades of life.
METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging data from multiple centers (IXI, MMRR, NKI, OASIS combined with the NIH-Child Dev database and locally recruited healthy subjects), we analyzed the lifespan trajectory of ERC thickness in 1,660 healthy controls ranging from 2 to 94 years of age.
RESULTS: The ERC thickness increased with age, reached a peak at about 44 years, and then decreased with age. ERC thickness is hemispherically rightward-asymmetric with no gender differences. Mean ERC thickness was found to vary between 2.943 $\pm$ .438 mm and 3.525 $\pm$ .355 mm across different age populations. Also, more pronounced loss of the ERC thickness in healthy aging men was noticeable.
DISCUSSION: Our report with high spatial resolution brain MRI data from 1,660 healthy controls provided important clues about ERC thickness across lifespan. We believe that our report will pave the way for the future studies investigating distinct neural pathologies related with cognitive dysfunctions.},

@article{Pustina:2016ab,
	abstract = {The gold standard for identifying stroke lesions is manual tracing, a method that is known to be observer dependent and time consuming, thus impractical for big data studies. We propose LINDA (Lesion Identification with Neighborhood Data Analysis), an automated segmentation algorithm capable of learning the relationship between existing manual segmentations and a single T1-weighted MRI. A dataset of 60 left hemispheric chronic stroke patients is used to build the method and test it with k-fold and leave-one-out procedures. With respect to manual tracings, predicted lesion maps showed a mean dice overlap of 0.696 $\pm$ 0.16, Hausdorff distance of 17.9 $\pm$ 9.8 mm, and average displacement of 2.54 $\pm$ 1.38 mm. The manual and predicted lesion volumes correlated at r = 0.961. An additional dataset of 45 patients was utilized to test LINDA with independent data, achieving high accuracy rates and confirming its cross-institutional applicability. To investigate the cost of moving from manual tracings to automated segmentation, we performed comparative lesion-to-symptom mapping (LSM) on five behavioral scores. Predicted and manual lesions produced similar neuro-cognitive maps, albeit with some discussed discrepancies. Of note, region-wise LSM was more robust to the prediction error than voxel-wise LSM. Our results show that, while several limitations exist, our current results compete with or exceed the state-of-the-art, producing consistent predictions, very low failure rates, and transferable knowledge between labs. This work also establishes a new viewpoint on evaluating automated methods not only with segmentation accuracy but also with brain-behavior relationships. LINDA is made available online with trained models from over 100 patients.},

@article{Filiano:2016ab,
	abstract = {Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental disorders. Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behaviour, such as spatial learning and memory. Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behaviour; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to T-cell-derived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social behaviour and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-γ and increase GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid) currents in projection neurons, suggesting that IFN-γ is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behaviour. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of a range of organisms reveals that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFN-γ/JAK-STAT-dependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the IFN-γ signalling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link between social/aggregation behaviour and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-γ, in disorders characterized by social dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between social behaviour and an anti-pathogen immune response driven by IFN-γ signalling.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a generally fatal neurodegenerative disease of adults that produces weakness and atrophy due to dysfunction and death of upper and lower motor neurons. We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze expression of all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded respiratory genes in ALS and CTL human cervical spinal cords (hCSC) and isolated motor neurons. We analyzed with RNA-seq mtDNA gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC) exposed to recombinant human mitochondrial transcription factor A (rhTFAM), visualized in 3-dimensions clustered gene networks activated by rhTFAM, quantitated their interactions with other genes and determined their gene ontology (GO) families. RNA-seq and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses showed reduced mitochondrial gene expression in ALS hCSC and ALS motor neurons isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM), and revealed that hNSC and CTL human cervical spinal cords were similar. Rats treated with i.v. rhTFAM showed a dose-response increase in brain respiration and an increase in spinal cord mitochondrial gene expression. Treatment of hNSC with rhTFAM increased expression of mtDNA-encoded respiratory genes and produced one major and several minor clusters of gene interactions. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of rhTFAM-stimulated gene clusters revealed enrichment in GO families involved in RNA and mRNA metabolism, suggesting mitochondrial-nuclear signaling. In postmortem ALS hCSC and LCM-isolated motor neurons we found reduced expression of mtDNA respiratory genes. In hNSC's rhTFAM increased mtDNA gene expression and stimulated mRNA metabolism by unclear mechanisms. rhTFAM may be useful in improving bioenergetic function in ALS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess how quantitative CT (qCT) metrics compare to pulmonary function testing (PFT) and semi-quantitative image scores (SQS) to diagnose bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), manifestation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation (LTx), according to the type of LTx (unilateral or bilateral).
METHODS: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans and PFTs of 176 LTx patients were analyzed retrospectively, and separated into BOS (78) and non-BOS (98) cohorts. SQS were assessed by 2 radiologists and graded (0-3) for features including mosaic attenuation and bronchiectasis. qCT metrics included lung volumes and air trapping volumes. Multivariate logistic regression (MVLR) and support vector machines (SVM) were used for the classification task.
RESULTS: MVLR and SVM models using PFT metrics demonstrated highest accuracy for bilateral LTx (max AUC 0.771), whereas models using qCT metrics-only outperformed models using SQS or PFTs in unilateral LTx (max AUC 0.817), to diagnose BOS. Adding PC (principal components) from qCT on top of PFT improved model diagnostic accuracy for all transplant types.
CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of qCT metrics augment the diagnostic performance of PFTs, are superior to SQS to predict BOS status, and outperform PFTs in the unilateral LTx group. This suggests that latent information on paired volumetric CT may allow early diagnosis of BOS in LTx patients, particularly in unilateral LTx.},

	abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion examinations enable noninvasive quantification of myocardial blood flow. However, motion between frames due to breathing must be corrected for quantitative analysis. Although several methods have been proposed, there is a lack of widely available benchmarks to compare different algorithms. We sought to compare many algorithms from several groups in an open benchmark challenge. Nine clinical studies from two different centers comprising normal and diseased myocardium at both rest and stress were made available for this study. The primary validation measure was regional myocardial blood flow based on the transfer coefficient (Ktrans), which was computed using a compartment model and the myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) index. The ground truth was calculated using contours drawn manually on all frames by a single observer, and visually inspected by a second observer. Six groups participated and 19 different motion correction algorithms were compared. Each method used one of three different motion models: rigid, global affine, or local deformation. The similarity metric also varied with methods employing either sum-of-squared differences, mutual information, or cross correlation. There were no significant differences in Ktrans or MPR compared across different motion models or similarity metrics. Compared with the ground truth, only Ktrans for the sum-of-squared differences metric, and for local deformation motion models, had significant bias. In conclusion, the open benchmark enabled evaluation of clinical perfusion indices over a wide range of methods. In particular, there was no benefit of nonrigid registration techniques over the other methods evaluated in this study. The benchmark data and results are available from the Cardiac Atlas Project ( www.cardiacatlas.org).},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: It remains unclear how prone positioning improves survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Using serial computed tomography (CT), we previously reported that "unstable" inflation (i.e., partial aeration with large tidal density swings, indicating increased local strain) is associated with injury progression.
OBJECTIVES: We prospectively tested whether prone position contains the early propagation of experimental lung injury by stabilizing inflation.
METHODS: Injury was induced by tracheal hydrochloric acid in rats; after randomization to supine or prone position, injurious ventilation was commenced using high tidal volume and low positive end-expiratory pressure. Paired end-inspiratory (EI) and end-expiratory (EE) CT scans were acquired at baseline and hourly up to 3 hours. Each sequential pair (EI, EE) of CT images was superimposed in parametric response maps to analyze inflation. Unstable inflation was then measured in each voxel in both dependent and nondependent lung. In addition, five pigs were imaged (EI and EE) prone versus supine, before and (1 hour) after hydrochloric acid aspiration.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In rats, prone position limited lung injury propagation and increased survival (11/12 vs. 7/12 supine; P = 0.01). EI-EE densities, respiratory mechanics, and blood gases deteriorated more in supine versus prone rats. At baseline, more voxels with unstable inflation occurred in dependent versus nondependent regions when supine (41 $\pm$ 6% vs. 18 $\pm$ 7%; P < 0.01) but not when prone. In supine pigs, unstable inflation predominated in dorsal regions and was attenuated by prone positioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Prone position limits the radiologic progression of early lung injury. Minimizing unstable inflation in this setting may alleviate the burden of acute respiratory distress syndrome.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is among the earliest brain areas to deteriorate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent to which functional properties of the EC are altered in the aging brain, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, is not understood. Recent human fMRI studies have identified a functional dissociation within the EC, similar to what is found in rodents. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to identify a specific hypoactivity in the anterolateral EC (alEC) commensurate with major behavioral deficits on an object pattern separation task in asymptomatic older adults. Only subtle deficits were found in a comparable spatial condition, with no associated differences in posteromedial EC between young and older adults. We additionally linked this condition to dentate/CA3 hyperactivity, and the ratio of activity between the regions was associated with object mnemonic discrimination impairment. These results provide novel evidence of alEC-dentate/CA3 circuit dysfunction in cognitively normal aged humans.},

We hypothesized that structural measures would correlate with 18F-AV-1451 in a spatially local manner and that this correlation would be stronger for longitudinal compared to cross-sectional measures of cortical thickness and in those with cerebral amyloid versus those without. Cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of voxelwise atrophy were made from whole brain maps of cortical thickness and rates of thickness change. In amyloid-β-positive individuals, the correlation of voxelwise atrophy across the whole brain with a summary measure of medial temporal lobe (MTL) 18F-AV-1451 uptake demonstrated strong local correlations in the MTL with longitudinal atrophy that was weaker in cross-sectional analysis. Similar effects were seen in correlations between 31 bilateral cortical regions of interest. In addition, several nonlocal correlations between atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake were observed, including association between MTL atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake in parietal lobe regions of interest such as the precuneus. Amyloid-β-negative individuals only showed weaker correlations in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons. While these data replicate previous reports of associations between 18F-AV-1451 uptake and cross-sectional structural measures, the current results demonstrate a strong relationship with longitudinal measures of atrophy. These data support the notion that in vivo measures of tau pathology are tightly linked to the rate of neurodegenerative change.},

However, little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive function in older African Americans and how they relate to genetic risk for AD. In particular, no past study on African Americans has examined the effect of APOE ε4 status on pattern separation-mnemonic discrimination performance and its corresponding neural computations in the hippocampus. Previous work using the mnemonic discrimination paradigm has localized increased activation in the DG/CA3 hippocampal subregions as being correlated with discrimination deficits. In a case-control high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging study of 30 healthy African Americans, aged 60 years and older, we observed APOE ε4-related impairments in mnemonic discrimination, coincident with dysfunctional hyperactivation in the DG/CA3, and CA1 regions, despite no evidence of structural differences in the hippocampus between carriers and noncarriers. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that deficits in pattern separation may be an early marker for AD-related neuronal dysfunction.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly heterogeneous and not well understood. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe129) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique way to assess important lung functions such as gas uptake. In this pilot study, we exploited multiple imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), gadolinium-enhanced perfusion MRI, and Xe129 MRI, to perform a detailed investigation of changes in lung morphology and functions in COPD. Utility and strengths of Xe129 MRI in assessing COPD were also evaluated against the other imaging modalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four COPD patients and four age-matched normal subjects participated in this study. Lung tissue density measured by CT, perfusion measures from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and ventilation and gas uptake measures from Xe129 MRI were calculated for individual lung lobes to assess regional changes in lung morphology and function, and to investigate correlations among the different imaging modalities.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found for all measures among the five lobes in either the COPD or age-matched normal group. Strong correlations (R > 0.5 or < -0.5, p < 0.001) were found between ventilation and perfusion measures. Also gas uptake by blood as measured by Xe129 MRI showed strong correlations with CT tissue density and ventilation measures (R > 0.5 or < -0.5, p < 0.001) and moderate to strong correlations with perfusion measures (R > 0.4 or < -0.5, p < 0.01). Four distinctive patterns of functional abnormalities were found in patients with COPD.
CONCLUSION: Xe129 MRI has high potential to uniquely identify multiple changes in lung physiology in COPD using a single breath-hold acquisition.},

@article{Tustison:2019ab,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

Humans also demonstrate changes in memory and hippocampus with corticosteroids. In this report the effects of glutamate-release inhibitor lamotrigine on hippocampal structure and memory were examined in people receiving medically needed prescription corticosteroid therapy. A total of 54 outpatient adults (n = 28 women) receiving chronic (≥ 6 months) oral corticosteroid therapy were randomized to lamotrigine or placebo for 48 weeks. Declarative memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) focused on hippocampus were obtained at baseline and week 48. Utilizing a mixed-model approach, structural and biochemical data were examined by separate ANOVAs, and memory was assessed with a multi-level longitudinal model. RAVLT total scores demonstrated significantly better declarative memory performance with lamotrigine than placebo (p = 0.047). Hippocampal subfield volumes were not significantly different between the treatment groups. In summary, lamotrigine was associated with less decline in declarative memory performance than placebo in corticosteroid-treated patients. Findings suggest that, in humans as well as in animal models, glutamate release inhibitors may attenuate some of the effects on the human memory associated with corticosteroids.},

@article{Feng:2019aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) is a key step in radiation treatment planning to reduce human efforts and bias. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have shown great success in many medical image segmentation applications but there are still challenges in dealing with large 3D images for optimal results. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel DCNN method for thoracic OARs segmentation using cropped 3D images.
METHODS: To segment the five organs (left and right lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord) from the thoracic CT scans, preprocessing to unify the voxel spacing and intensity was first performed, a 3D U-Net was then trained on resampled thoracic images to localize each organ, then the original images were cropped to only contain one organ and served as the input to each individual organ segmentation network. The segmentation maps were then merged to get the final results. The network structures were optimized for each step, as well as the training and testing strategies. A novel testing augmentation with multiple iterations of image cropping was used. The networks were trained on 36 thoracic CT scans with expert annotations provided by the organizers of the 2017 AAPM Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge and tested on the challenge testing dataset as well as a private dataset.
RESULTS: The proposed method earned second place in the live phase of the challenge and first place in the subsequent ongoing phase using a newly developed testing augmentation approach. It showed superior-than-human performance on average in terms of Dice scores (spinal cord: 0.893 $\pm$ 0.044, right lung: 0.972 $\pm$ 0.021, left lung: 0.979 $\pm$ 0.008, heart: 0.925 $\pm$ 0.015, esophagus: 0.726 $\pm$ 0.094), mean surface distance (spinal cord: 0.662 $\pm$ 0.248 mm, right lung: 0.933 $\pm$ 0.574 mm, left lung: 0.586 $\pm$ 0.285 mm, heart: 2.297 $\pm$ 0.492 mm, esophagus: 2.341 $\pm$ 2.380 mm) and 95% Hausdorff distance (spinal cord: 1.893 $\pm$ 0.627 mm, right lung: 3.958 $\pm$ 2.845 mm, left lung: 2.103 $\pm$ 0.938 mm, heart: 6.570 $\pm$ 1.501 mm, esophagus: 8.714 $\pm$ 10.588 mm). It also achieved good performance in the private dataset and reduced the editing time to 7.5 min per patient following automatic segmentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DCNN method demonstrated good performance in automatic OAR segmentation from thoracic CT scans. It has the potential for eventual clinical adoption of deep learning in radiation treatment planning due to improved accuracy and reduced cost for OAR segmentation.},

In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks. Although of primary importance within the quantitative imaging domain, image registration algorithmic development, in the context of these deep learning strategies, has received comparatively less attention than its counterparts (e.g., image segmentation). Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues. We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.},

	abstract = {Automated neuroimaging methods like FreeSurfer ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) have revolutionized quantitative neuroimaging analyses. Such analyses provide a variety of metrics used for image quantification, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetrics. With the release of FreeSurfer version 6.0, it is important to assess its comparability to the widely-used previous version 5.3. The current study used data from the initial 249 participants in the ongoing Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) multicenter observational study to compare the volumetric output of versions 5.3 and 6.0 across various regions of interest (ROI). In the current investigation, the following ROIs were examined: total intracranial volume, total white matter volume, total ventricular volume, total gray matter volume, and right and left volumes for the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, caudate, amygdala and hippocampus. Absolute ROI volumes derived from FreeSurfer 6.0 differed significantly from those obtained using version 5.3. We also employed a clinically-based evaluation strategy to compare both versions in their prediction of age-mediated volume reductions (or ventricular increase) in the aforementioned structures. Statistical comparison involved both general linear modeling (GLM) and random forest (RF) methods, where cross-validation error was significantly higher using segmentations from FreeSurfer version 5.3 versus version 6.0 (GLM: t = 4.97, df = 99, p value = 2.706e-06; RF: t = 4.85, df = 99, p value = 4.424e-06). Additionally, the relative importance of ROIs used to predict age using RFs differed between FreeSurfer versions, indicating substantial differences in the two versions. However, from the perspective of correlational analyses, fitted regression lines and their slopes were similar between the two versions, regardless of version used. While absolute volumes are not interchangeable between version 5.3 and 6.0, ROI correlational analyses appear to yield similar results, suggesting the interchangeability of ROI volume for correlational studies.},

	abstract = {Liquid-solid (LS) and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) interfaces are important for the fundamental understanding of how surface chemistry impacts industrial processes and applications. Superhydrophobic surfaces, from structural hierarchies, were fabricated by coating flat smooth surfaces with hollow glass microspheres. These surfaces are referred to as structural hierarchical-modified microsphere surfaces (SHiMMs). Two-phase LS and three-phase VLS interfaces of water droplets on SHiMMs, with an apparent static contact angle (aSCA) of ∼160$\,^{\circ}$, were probed at microscale using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and high-resolution optical microscopy (OM). Both ESEM and OM confirmed the presence of air pockets in 3-150 μm range at the VLS triple-phase of the droplet peripheral contact line. The wetting characteristics of the LS interface in the interior of the water droplet were probed using energy-dispersive spectroscopy, which corroborated well with the VLS triple-phase observations, confirming the presence of both the microscale air pockets and fractional complete wetting of the SHiMMs. The superhydrophobic water droplets on the SHiMMs also exhibited relatively high adhesion to the SHiMMs-a tilt angle of 10$\,^{\circ}$-40$\,^{\circ}$ was needed for detaching the droplets off the surfaces. Semiquantitative three-phase contact-line analysis and experimental data indicated high-water aSCA, and large adhesion on the microscale-roughened SHiMMs is attributed to pinning of the probe liquid both at the triple VLS and interior LS interfaces. The control over microroughness and surface chemistry of the SHiMMs will allow tuning of both the static and dynamic liquid-surface interactions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

	abstract = {Diffeomorphic mappings are central to image registration due largely to their topological properties and success in providing biologically plausible solutions to deformation and morphological estimation problems. Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the well-known SyN algorithm (Avants et al., 2008), implemented within the same framework, and its B-spline analog is performed using open labeled brain data and open source evaluation tools. },

	abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung ventilation defects identified by using hyperpolarized 3-helium gas ((3)He) lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are prevalent in asthmatic patients, but the clinical importance of ventilation defects is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to correlate the lung defect volume quantified by using (3)He MRI with clinical features in children with mild and severe asthma.
METHODS: Thirty-one children with asthma (median age, 10 years; age range, 3-17 years) underwent detailed characterization and (3)He lung MRI. Quantification of the (3)He signal defined ventilation defect and hypoventilated, ventilated, and well-ventilated volumes.
RESULTS: The ventilation defect to total lung volume fraction ranged from 0.1% to 11.6%. Children with ventilation defect percentages in the upper tercile were more likely to have severe asthma than children in the lower terciles (P = .005). The ventilation defect percentage correlated (P < .05 for all) positively with the inhaled corticosteroid dose, total number of controller medications, and total blood eosinophil counts and negatively with the Asthma Control Test score, FEV1 (percent predicted), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (percent predicted), and forced expiratory flow rate from 25% to 75% of expired volume (percent predicted).
CONCLUSION: The lung defect volume percentage measured by using (3)He MRI correlates with several clinical features of asthma, including severity, symptom score, medication requirement, airway physiology, and atopic markers.},

@article{Guo:2017aa,
	abstract = {Neuroimaging measurements derived from magnetic resonance imaging provide important information required for detecting changes related to the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical features and changes play a crucial role in revealing unique anatomical patterns of brain regions, and further differentiate MCI patients from normal states. Four cortical features, namely, gray matter volume, cortical thickness, surface area, and mean curvature, were explored for discriminative analysis among three groups including the stable MCI (sMCI), the converted MCI (cMCI), and the normal control (NC) groups. In this study, 158 subjects (72 NC, 46 sMCI, and 40 cMCI) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. A sparse-constrained regression model based on the l2-1-norm was introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the discrimination of the three groups by using a support vector machine (SVM). An optimized strategy of feature addition based on the weight of each feature was adopted for the SVM classifier in order to achieve the best classification performance. The baseline cortical features combined with the longitudinal measurements for 2 years of follow-up data yielded prominent classification results. In particular, the cortical thickness produced a classification with 98.84% accuracy, 97.5% sensitivity, and 100% specificity for the sMCI-cMCI comparison; 92.37% accuracy, 84.78% sensitivity, and 97.22% specificity for the cMCI-NC comparison; and 93.75% accuracy, 92.5% sensitivity, and 94.44% specificity for the sMCI-NC comparison. The best performances obtained by the SVM classifier using the essential features were 5-40% more than those using all of the retained features. The feasibility of the cortical features for the recognition of anatomical patterns was certified; thus, the proposed method has the potential to improve the clinical diagnosis of sub-types of MCI and predict the risk of its conversion to Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncertain prediction of outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) impedes individual patient management and clinical trial design.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiological metric of injurious inflation derived from matched inspiratory and expiratory CT scans, calibrate it in a model of experimental lung injury, and test it in patients with ARDS.
METHODS: 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed.
RESULTS: In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p<0.01). In patients with ARDS, a threshold fraction of tissue with unstable inflation was apparent: >28% in all patients who died and ≤28% in all who survived, whereas segregation of survivors versus non-survivors was not possible based on oxygenation or lung mechanics.
CONCLUSIONS: A single set of superimposed inspiratory-expiratory CT scans may predict progression of lung injury and outcome in ARDS; if these preliminary results are validated, this could facilitate clinical trial recruitment and individualised care.},

	abstract = {Obesity is increasingly prevalent and associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for determination of body fat volume and distribution. However, quantifying body fat from numerous MRI slices is tedious and time-consuming. Here we developed a deep learning-based method for measuring visceral and subcutaneous fat in the abdominal region of mice. Congenic mice only differ from C57BL/6 (B6) Apoe knockout (Apoe-/-) mice in chromosome 9 that is replaced by C3H/HeJ genome. Male congenic mice had lighter body weight than B6-Apoe-/- mice after being fed 14 weeks of Western diet. Axial and coronal T1-weighted sequencing at 1-mm-thickness and 1-mm-gap was acquired with a 7T Bruker ClinScan scanner. A deep learning approach was developed for segmenting visceral and subcutaneous fat based on the U-net architecture made publicly available through the open-source ANTsRNet library-a growing repository of well-known neural networks. The volumes of subcutaneous and visceral fat measured through our approach were highly comparable with those from manual measurements. The Dice score, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and correlation analysis demonstrated the similarity between two methods in quantifying visceral and subcutaneous fat. Analysis with the automated method showed significant reductions in volumes of visceral and subcutaneous fat but not non-fat tissues in congenic mice compared to B6 mice. These results demonstrate the accuracy of deep learning in quantification of abdominal fat and its significance in determining body weight.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after lung transplantation (LTx) manifests as a sustained decline in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) metrics may predict FEV1 better than semiquantitative scores (SQSs), and the transplanted lung may provide better information than the native lung in unilateral LTx.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans and pulmonary function testing of 178 LTx patients were analyzed retrospectively. SQS were graded (absent, mild, moderate, severe) for features including mosaic attenuation and bronchiectasis. QCT included lung volumes and air-trapping volumes, by lobe. Multivariate Pearson correlation and multivariate linear least squares regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Multivariate linear least squares regression models using FEV1 as the outcome variable and SQS or QCT metrics as predictor variables demonstrated SQS to be a weak predictor of FEV1 (adjusted R, 0.114). QCT metrics were much stronger predictors of FEV1 (adjusted R, 0.654). QCT metrics demonstrated stronger correlation (r) with FEV1 than SQS. In bilateral LTx, whole lung volume difference (r=0.69), left lung volume difference (r=0.69), and right lung volume difference (r=0.65) were better than the sum of SQS (r=-0.54). Interestingly, in left LTx we obtained r=0.81, 0.86, 0.25, and -0.39, respectively. In right LTx, we obtained r=0.69, 0.49, 0.68, and -0.31, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: QCT metrics demonstrate stronger correlations with FEV1 and are better predictors of pulmonary function than SQS. SQS performs moderately well in bilateral LTx, but poorly on unilateral LTx. In unilateral LTx, QCT metrics from the transplanted lung are better predictors of FEV1 than QCT metrics from the nontransplanted lung.},

	abstract = {Laboratory mice are staples for evo/devo and genetics studies. Inbred strains provide a uniform genetic background to manipulate and understand gene-environment interactions, while their crosses have been instrumental in studies of genetic architecture, integration and modularity, and mapping of complex biological traits. Recently, there have been multiple large-scale studies of laboratory mice to further our understanding of the developmental basis, evolution, and genetic control of shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton (i.e. skull and mandible). These experiments typically use micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to capture the craniofacial phenotype in 3D and rely on manually annotated anatomical landmarks to conduct statistical shape analysis. Although the common choice for imaging modality and phenotyping provides the potential for collaborative research for even larger studies with more statistical power, the investigator (or lab-specific) nature of the data collection hampers these efforts. Investigators are rightly concerned that subtle differences in how anatomical landmarks were recorded will create systematic bias between studies that will eventually influence scientific findings. Even if researchers are willing to repeat landmark annotation on a combined dataset, different lab practices and software choices may create obstacles for standardization beyond the underlying imaging data. Here, we propose a freely available analysis system that could assist in the standardization of micro-CT studies in the mouse. Our proposal uses best practices developed in biomedical imaging and takes advantage of existing open-source software and imaging formats. Our first contribution is the creation of a synthetic template for the adult mouse craniofacial skeleton from 25 inbred strains and five F1 crosses that are widely used in biological research. The template contains a fully segmented cranium, left and right hemi-mandibles, endocranial space, and the first few cervical vertebrae. We have been using this template in our lab to segment and isolate cranial structures in an automated fashion from a mixed population of mice, including craniofacial mutants, aged 4-12.5 weeks. As a secondary contribution, we demonstrate an application of nearly automated shape analysis, using symmetric diffeomorphic image registration. This approach, which we call diGPA, closely approximates the popular generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) but negates the collection of anatomical landmarks. We achieve our goals by using the open-source advanced normalization tools (ANT) image quantification library, as well as its associated R library (ANTsR) for statistical image analysis. Finally, we make a plea to investigators to commit to using open imaging standards and software in their labs to the extent possible to increase the potential for data exchange and improve the reproducibility of findings. Future work will incorporate more anatomical detail (such as individual cranial bones, turbinals, dentition, middle ear ossicles) and more diversity into the template.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are foci of abnormal signal intensity in white matter regions seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). WMHs are associated with normal ageing and have shown prognostic value in neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). The impracticality of manually quantifying these lesions limits their clinical utility and motivates the utilization of machine learning techniques for automated segmentation workflows.
METHODS: This study develops a concatenated random forest framework with image features for segmenting WMHs in a TBI cohort. The framework is built upon the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and ANTsR toolkits. MR (3D FLAIR, T2- and T1-weighted) images from 24 service members and veterans scanned in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium's (CENC) observational study were acquired. Manual annotations were employed for both training and evaluation using a leave-one-out strategy. Performance measures include sensitivity, positive predictive value, [Formula: see text] score and relative volume difference.
RESULTS: Final average results were: sensitivity = 0.68 $\pm$ 0.38, positive predictive value = 0.51 $\pm$ 0.40, [Formula: see text] = 0.52 $\pm$ 0.36, relative volume difference = 43 $\pm$ 26%. In addition, three lesion size ranges are selected to illustrate the variation in performance with lesion size.
CONCLUSION: Paired with correlative outcome data, supervised learning methods may allow for identification of imaging features predictive of diagnosis and prognosis in individual TBI patients.},

	abstract = {The assessment of early pulmonary disease and its severity can be difficult in young children, as procedures such as spirometry cannot be performed on them. Computed tomography provides detailed structural images of the pulmonary parenchyma, but its major drawback is that the patient is exposed to ionizing radiation. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising technique for the evaluation of pediatric lung disease, especially when serial imaging is needed. Traditionally, MRI played a small role in evaluating the pulmonary parenchyma. Because of its low proton density, the lungs display low signal intensity on conventional proton-based MRI. Hyperpolarized (HP) gases are inhaled contrast agents with an excellent safety profile and provide high signal within the lung, allowing for high temporal and spatial resolution imaging of the lung airspaces. Besides morphologic information, HP MR images also offer valuable information about pulmonary physiology. HP gas MRI has already made new contributions to the understanding of pediatric lung diseases and may become a clinically useful tool. In this article, we discuss the HP gas MRI technique, special considerations that need to be made when imaging children, and the role of MRI in 2 of the most common chronic pediatric lung diseases, asthma and cystic fibrosis. We also will discuss how HP gas MRI may be used to evaluate normal lung growth and development and the alterations occurring in chronic lung disease of prematurity and in patients with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a method for acquiring helium-3 ((3) He) and proton ((1) H) three-dimensional (3D) image sets of the human lung with isotropic spatial resolution within a 10-s breath-hold by using compressed sensing (CS) acceleration, and to assess the fidelity of undersampled images compared with fully sampled images.
METHODS: The undersampling scheme for CS acceleration was optimized and tested using (3) He ventilation data. Rapid 3D acquisition of both (3) He and (1) H data during one breath-hold was then implemented, based on a balanced steady-state free-precession pulse sequence, by random undersampling of k-space with reconstruction by means of minimizing the L1 norm and total variance. CS-reconstruction fidelity was evaluated quantitatively by comparing fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled image sets.
RESULTS: Helium-3 and (1) H 3D image sets of the lung with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution were acquired during a single breath-hold in 12 s and 8 s using acceleration factors of 2 and 3, respectively. Comparison of fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled (3) He and (1) H images yielded mean absolute errors <10% and structural similarity indices >0.9.
CONCLUSION: By randomly undersampling k-space and using CS reconstruction, high-quality (3) He and (1) H 3D image sets with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution can be acquired within an 8-s breath-hold.},

	abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package--a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

@article{Xin:2015aa,
	abstract = {Quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) is essential to the study of acute lung injury. However, quantitative CT is made difficult by poor lung aeration, which complicates the critical step of image segmentation. To overcome this obstacle, this study sought to develop and validate a semiautomated, multilandmark, registration-based scheme for lung segmentation that is effective in conditions of poor aeration. Expiratory and inspiratory CT images were obtained in rats (n = 8) with surfactant depletion of incremental severity to mimic worsening aeration. Trained operators manually delineated the images to provide a comparative landmark. Semiautomatic segmentation originated from a single, previously segmented reference image obtained at healthy baseline. Deformable registration of the target images (after surfactant depletion) was performed using the symmetric diffeomorphic transformation model with B-spline regularization. Registration used multiple landmarks (i.e., rib cage, spine, and lung parenchyma) to minimize the effect of poor aeration. Then target images were automatically segmented by applying the calculated transformation function to the reference image contour. Semiautomatically and manually segmented contours proved to be highly similar in all aeration conditions, including those characterized by more severe surfactant depletion and expiration. The Dice similarity coefficient was over 0.9 in most conditions, confirming high agreement, irrespective of poor aeration. Furthermore, CT density-based measurements of gas volume, tissue mass, and lung aeration distribution were minimally affected by the method of segmentation. Moving forward, multilandmark registration has the potential to streamline quantitative CT analysis by enabling semiautomatic image segmentation of lungs with a broad range of injury severity.},

@article{Tustison:2014ad,
	abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size--an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias.},

@article{Teague:2014aa,
	abstract = {Non-uniform distribution of inspired gas within the lung, termed ventilation heterogeneity, is present in patients with even mild asthma. Current evidence strongly supports ventilation heterogeneity as a fundamental derangement of lung function in asthma that contributes per se to hypoxemia and airway hyper-responsiveness. An extreme example of ventilation heterogeneity is the identification by hyperpolarized gas MRI of lung regions with no ventilation, termed filling defects. Lung filling defects in patients with asthma can persist over time, increase in size with methacholine-induced bronchospasm and more likely are caused by obstruction of the peripheral and not the proximal airways. Ventilation heterogeneity can be quantified in the conducting and acinar lung zones with the multiple gas washout method, and in the acinar zone does not fully resolve following bronchodilator treatment in patients with asthma. In prospective studies, the degree of ventilation heterogeneity at baseline predicts airway hyper-responsiveness and response to corticosteroid dose titration. An important unanswered question is the relationship of airways inflammation to ventilation heterogeneity. In consideration of the importance of ventilation heterogeneity in its pathobiology, asthma is more a focal disorder with regional pathology akin to regional ileitis and not the generalized disorder of the airways as it has been viewed in the past.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Fourteen patients were ultimately included. DT MR imaging studies at 3.0 T were performed preoperatively and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated from the DT imaging data sets for all time points in all patients. Voxels where FA consistently decreased over time were identified, and FA change in these voxels was correlated with clinical changes in tremor over the same period by using Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: Ipsilateral brain structures that showed prespecified negative correlation values of FA over time of -0.5 or less included the pre- and postcentral subcortical white matter in the hand knob area; the region of the corticospinal tract in the centrum semiovale, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the cerebral peduncle; the thalamus; the region of the red nucleus; the location of the central tegmental tract; and the region of the inferior olive. The contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral portions of the superior vermis also showed persistent decrease in FA over time. There was strong correlation between decrease in FA and clinical improvement in hand tremor 3 months after lesion inducement (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy depicts changes in specific brain structures. The magnitude of the DT imaging changes after thalamic lesion inducement correlates with the degree of clinical improvement in essential tremor.},

Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

	abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models--one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations.

	abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},

Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually.

	abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

	abstract = {In adult canines following major lung resection, the remaining lobes expand asymmetrically, associated with alveolar tissue regrowth, remodeling, and progressive functional compensation over many months. To permit noninvasive longitudinal assessment of regional growth and function, we performed serial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) on six male dogs (∼9 mo old, 25.0 $\pm$ 4.5 kg, $\pm$SD) at 15 and 30 cmH(2)O transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) before resection (PRE) and 3 and 15 mo postresection (POST3 and POST15, respectively) of 65-70% of lung units. At POST3, lobar air volume increased 83-148% and tissue (including microvascular blood) volume 120-234% above PRE values without further changes at POST15. Lobar-specific compliance (Cs) increased 52-137% from PRE to POST3 and 28-79% from POST3 to POST15. Inflation-related parenchyma strain and shear were estimated by detailed registration of corresponding anatomical features at each Ptp. Within each lobe, regional displacement was most pronounced at the caudal region, whereas strain was pronounced in the periphery. Regional three-dimensional strain magnitudes increased heterogeneously from PRE to POST3, with further medial-lateral increases from POST3 to POST15. Lobar principal strains (PSs) were unchanged or modestly elevated postresection; changes in lobar maximum PS correlated inversely with changes in lobar air and tissue volumes. Lobar shear distortion increased in coronal and transverse planes at POST3 without further changes thereafter. These results establish a novel use of functional HRCT to map heterogeneous regional deformation during compensatory lung growth and illustrate a stimulus-response feedback loop whereby postresection mechanical stress initiates differential lobar regrowth and sustained remodeling, which in turn, relieves parenchyma stress and strain, resulting in progressive increases in lobar Cs and a delayed increase in whole lung Cs.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi-detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels > -50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels < -950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters.
RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity (r = 0.83). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum r value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume (r = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema.
CONCLUSIONS: Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway-related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD.
RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92% error rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},
