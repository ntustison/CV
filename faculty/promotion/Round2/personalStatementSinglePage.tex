\textbf{Nicholas J. Tustison, DSc}

\emph{Describe engagement with learners in your mission area of
excellence (clinical, research, education, community).}

I am a co-founder and developer of the widely recognized open-source
Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem (ANTsX) which allows me to
simultaneously engage with learners and contribute to ongoing research.
This has led to significant opportunities for mentoring and teaching
students, post-graduate trainees, and other researchers by providing
numerous tutorials and workshops at various conferences and at different
academic and scientific institutions. I have also organized this
tutorial material for online public access. This is in addition to my
daily participation in the ANTsX online user forums.

\emph{Give a brief self-evaluation regarding adherence to ASPIRE values.
You should describe your contributions to at least one of the ASPIRE
values (Accountability, Stewardship, Professionalism, Integrity,
Respect, Equity).}

My approach to research and collaboration is guided by a deep commitment
to the development of high-quality, open-source computational strategies
for biological and medical imaging. I believe that such commitments
create a supportive and inclusive environment where knowledge is shared,
diverse perspectives are valued, and the quality of work is held to the
highest standards. Their importance has only increased since returning
to the University of Virginia in 2010 as an Assistant Professor and
subsequently during my current tenure as an Associate Professor.

\textbf{Personal Statement}

Throughout my academic career, I have benefited from caring mentors who
have dmeonstrated excellent academic scholarship and integrity while
promoting values of mutual respect. As an example, I continue to benefit
immensely from relationships developed during my initial post-graduate
years at the PICSL lab, particularly those at the University of
Pennsylvania in the Penn Image and Computing Science Laboratory under
the direction of Dr.~James C. Gee. While at the University of
Pennsylvania, my colleague, Dr.~Brian B. Avants, and I co-founded the
open-source Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem (ANTsX). This
software suite has evolved to become one of the most widely used and
highly cited libraries in the field in both academia and industry for
image data processing and analysis. Recently, Dr.~Gee and I have
leveraged ANTs development in the successful application of two
explicitly ANTs-based NIH R01 grants.

One of the benefits of being a part of a premier research university are
the many opportunities for collaboration with internationally recognized
scientists targeting a variety of clinical applications. As one of the
leading institutions in the field of functional lung imaging using
hyperpolarized gases, I have been part of a research team making
important algorithmic contributions to the field which have been
recently made available as a community resource at
(www.xenonanalysis.com). Analagous quantitative contributions have been
made in the field of traumatic brain injury with Dr.~James Stone and
Dr.~Avants. My research and development has also resulted in an
expansion of the circle of my collaborators beyond the University of
Virginia to include collaborations with people at such academic entities
and scientific institutions as the University of California, Irvine, the
University of Pennsylvania, and the Allen Brain Institute.

In parallel with the appreciation I have for my many external
opportunities for collaboration and mentoring, I am honored to be
associated with the University of Virginia and feel extremely fortunate
to work with its high quality faculty in exploring fascinating research
questions. I look forward to continuing my academic career at UVa where
I can best provide the necessary expertise for medical imaging data
science.
