\section{Personal Statement}\label{personal-statement}}

\emph{Nicholas J. Tustison, DSc}

As a scientist specializing in medical image analysis, my approach to
research and collaboration is guided by a deep commitment to the
development of high-quality, open-source computational strategies for
biological and medical imaging. I believe that such commitments create a
supportive and inclusive environment where knowledge is shared, diverse
perspectives are valued, and the quality of work is held to the highest
standards. Their importance has only increased since returning to the
University of Virginia in 2010 as an Assistant Professor and
subsequently during my current tenure as an Associate Professor.

Throughout my academic career, I have benefited from caring mentors who
have promoted excellent academic scholarship and integrity while
instilling values of mutual respect. As a prominent example, I continue
to benefit immensely from relationships developed during my initial
post-graduate years at the PICSL lab, particularly those at the
University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Image and Computing Science
Laboratory under the direction of Dr.~James C. Gee. While at the
University of Pennsylvania, my colleague, Dr.~Brian B. Avants, and I
co-founded the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). This software
package has become one of the most widely used toolkits in the field for
image data processing and analysis which are described by some of the
most highly cited publications in the field. Other packages, such as the
well-known FreeSurfer software package, have incorporated
well-performing and complementary ANTs components into their own
libraries. Recently, Dr.~Gee and I have leveraged this ANTs development
in receiving two explicitly ANTs-related NIH R01 grants.

Given my role in the development of such widely used research tools, my
focus has provided significant opportunities for mentoring, teaching,
and consulting within the research community. I have provided numerious
tutorials and workshops at various conferences and at different academic
and scientific institutions. I have also organized this tutorial
material for online access. This has also resulted in an expansion of
the circle of my collaborators beyond the University of Virginia to
include collaborations with people at such academic entities and
scientific institutions as the University of California, Irvine, the
University of Pennsylvania, and the Allen Brain Institute. In addition,
given the credibility that the ANTs software has, I am often asked to
provide evaluative comparison data for international competitions and
standardized data for further processing of large-scale studies.

In parallel with the appreciation I have for my many external
opportunities for collaboration and mentoring, I am honored to be
associated with the University of Virginia and feel extremely fortunate
to work with its high quality faculty in exploring fascinating research
questions. I look forward to continuing my academic career at UVa where
I can best provide the necessary expertise for medical imaging data
science.
