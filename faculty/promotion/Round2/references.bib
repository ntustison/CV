	abstract = {To investigate whether hyperpolarised xenon-129 MRI (HXeMRI) enables regional and physiological resolution of diffusing capacity limitations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we evaluated 34 COPD subjects and 11 healthy volunteers. We report significant correlations between airflow abnormality quantified by HXeMRI and per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s; HXeMRI gas transfer capacity to red blood cells and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (%DLCO); and HXeMRI gas transfer capacity to interstitium and per cent emphysema quantified by multidetector chest CT. We further demonstrate the capability of HXeMRI to distinguish varying pathology underlying COPD in subjects with low %DLCO and minimal emphysema.},

@article{Gerald-Teague:2021aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperpolarized gas with helium (HHe-3) MR (magnetic resonance) is a noninvasive imaging method which maps and quantifies regions of ventilation heterogeneity (VH) in the lung. VH is an important feature of asthma, but little is known as to how VH informs patient phenotypes.
PURPOSE: To determine if VH indicators quantified by HHe-3 MR imaging (MRI) predict phenotypic characteristics and map to regions of inflammation in children with problematic wheeze or asthma.
METHODS: Sixty children with poorly-controlled wheeze or asthma underwent HHe-3 MRI, including 22 with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The HHe-3 signal intensity defined four ventilation compartments. The non-ventilated and hypoventilated compartments divided by the total lung volume defined a VH index (VHI %).
RESULTS: Children with VHI % in the upper quartile had significantly greater airflow limitation, bronchodilator responsiveness, blood eosinophils, expired nitric oxide (FeNO), and BAL eosinophilic or neutrophilic granulocyte patterns compared to children with VHI % in the lower quartile. Lavage return from hypoventilated bronchial segments had greater eosinophil % than from ventilated segments.
CONCLUSION: In children with asthma, greater VHI % as measured by HHe-3 MRI identifies a severe phenotype with higher type 2 inflammatory markers, and maps to regions of lung eosinophilia. Listed on ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02577497).},

@article{McMakin:2022aa,
	abstract = {This study examines neural mechanisms of negative overgeneralization, the increased likelihood of generalizing negative information, in peri-puberty. Theories suggest that weak pattern separation [overlapping representations are made distinct, indexed by dentate gyrus/ cornu ammonis (CA)3 hippocampal subfield activation] underlies negative overgeneralization. We alternatively propose that neuro-maturational changes that favor pattern completion (cues reinstate stored representations, indexed by CA1 activation) are modulated by circuitry involved in emotional responding [amygdala, medial prefrontal cortices (mPFC)] to drive negative overgeneralization. Youth (n = 34, 9-14 years) recruited from community and clinic settings participated in an emotional mnemonic similarity task while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. At study, participants indicated the valence of images; at test, participants made recognition memory judgments. Critical lure stimuli, which were similar to images at study, were presented at test, and errors ('false alarms') to negative relative to neutral stimuli reflected negative overgeneralization. Negative overgeneralization was related to greater and more similar patterns of activation in CA1 and both dorsal mPFC (dmPFC)and ventral mPFC (vmPFC) for negative relative to neutral stimuli. At study, amygdala exhibited greater functional coupling with CA1 and dmPFC during negative items that were later generalized. Negative overgeneralization is rooted in amygdala and mPFC modulation at encoding and pattern completion at retrieval.},

@article{Mata:2021aa,
	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a pattern of interstitial lung disease, is often clinically unpredictable in its progression. This paper presents hyperpolarized Xenon-129 chemical shift imaging as a noninvasive, nonradioactive method of probing lung physiology as well as anatomy to monitor subtle changes in subjects with IPF. Twenty subjects, nine healthy and eleven IPF, underwent HP Xe-129 ventilation MRI and 3D-SBCSI. Spirometry was performed on all subjects before imaging, and DLCO and hematocrit were measured in IPF subjects after imaging. Images were post-processed in MATLAB and segmented using ANTs. IPF subjects exhibited, on average, higher Tissue/Gas ratios and lower RBC/Gas ratios compared with healthy subjects, and quantitative maps were more heterogeneous in IPF subjects. The higher ratios are likely due to fibrosis and thickening of the pulmonary interstitium. T2* relaxation was longer in IPF subjects and corresponded with hematocrit scores, although the mechanism is not well understood. A lower chemical shift in the red blood cell spectroscopic peak correlated well with a higher Tissue/RBC ratio and may be explained by reduced blood oxygenation. Tissue/RBC also correlated well, spatially, with areas of fibrosis in HRCT images. These results may help us understand the underlying mechanism behind gas exchange impairment and disease progression.},

@article{Song:2012aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of various image-based metrics computed from thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with data from pulmonary function testing (PFT) in characterizing interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with ILD and 11 with COPD had undergone both PFT and HRCT within 3 days. For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD.
RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92% error rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},

	abstract = {EMPIRE10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intrapatient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

@article{Tustison:2011aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

	abstract = {A computational framework is described that was developed for quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized helium-3 MR lung ventilation image data. This computational framework was applied to a study consisting of 55 subjects (47 asthmatic and eight normal). Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers.
RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as "breachers" or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Diverse, high-dimensional modalities collected in large cohorts present new opportunities for the formulation and testing of integrative scientific hypotheses. Similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR) is an algorithm that exploits inter-modality relationships to transform large scientific datasets into smaller, more well-powered and interpretable low-dimensional spaces. SiMLR contributes an objective function for identifying joint signal, regularization based on sparse matrices representing prior within-modality relationships and an implementation that permits application to joint reduction of large data matrices. We demonstrate that SiMLR outperforms closely related methods on supervised learning problems in simulation data, a multi-omics cancer survival prediction dataset and multiple modality neuroimaging datasets. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results in a variety of application domains.},

	abstract = {UK Biobank is a large-scale epidemiological resource for investigating prospective correlations between various lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors with health and disease progression. In addition to individual subject information obtained through surveys and physical examinations, a comprehensive neuroimaging battery consisting of multiple modalities provides imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that can serve as biomarkers in neuroscience research. In this study, we augment the existing set of UK Biobank neuroimaging structural IDPs, obtained from well-established software libraries such as FSL and FreeSurfer, with related measurements acquired through the Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem. This includes previously established cortical and subcortical measurements defined, in part, based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas. Also included are morphological measurements from two recent developments: medial temporal lobe parcellation of hippocampal and extra-hippocampal regions and the cerebellum. Through predictive modeling, we assess the clinical utility of these IDP measurements, individually and in combination, using commonly studied phenotypic correlates including age, fluid intelligence, numeric memory, and several other sociodemographic variables. The predictive accuracy of these IDP-based models, in terms of root-mean-squared-error or area-under-the-curve for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, provides comparative insights between software libraries as well as potential clinical interpretability. Results demonstrate varied performance between package-based IDP sets and their combination, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in their selection and utilization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSupport for the research reported in this work includes funding from a combined grant from Cohen Veterans Bioscience (CVB-461) and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-18-1-2440).

	abstract = {A central challenge of medical imaging studies is to extract biomarkers that characterize disease pathology or outcomes. Modern automated approaches have found tremendous success in high-resolution, high-quality magnetic resonance images. These methods, however, may not translate to low-resolution images acquired on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners with lower magnetic field strength. In low-resource settings where low-field scanners are more common and there is a shortage of radiologists to manually interpret MRI scans, it is critical to develop automated methods that can augment or replace manual interpretation, while accommodating reduced image quality. We present a fully automated framework for translating radiological diagnostic criteria into image-based biomarkers, inspired by a project in which children with cerebral malaria (CM) were imaged using low-field 0.35 Tesla MRI. We integrate multiatlas label fusion, which leverages high-resolution images from another sample as prior spatial information, with parametric Gaussian hidden Markov models based on image intensities, to create a robust method for determining ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volume. We also propose normalized image intensity and texture measurements to determine the loss of gray-to-white matter tissue differentiation and sulcal effacement. These integrated biomarkers have excellent classification performance for determining severe brain swelling due to CM.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in treatments for multiple sclerosis, insidious disease progression remains an area of unmet medical need, for which atrophy-based biomarkers may help better characterize the progressive biology.
METHODS: We developed and applied a method of longitudinal deformation-based morphometry to provide voxel-level assessments of brain volume changes and identified brain regions that were significantly impacted by disease-modifying therapy.
RESULTS: Using brain MRI data from two identically designed pivotal trials of relapsing multiple sclerosis (total N = 1483), we identified multiple deep brain regions, including the thalamus and brainstem, where volume loss over time was reduced by ocrelizumab (p < 0.05), a humanized anti-CD20 + monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, identified brainstem shrinkage, as well as brain ventricle expansion, was associated with a greater risk for confirmed disability progression (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of deep brain structures has a strong implication for developing new biomarkers of brain atrophy reduction to advance drug development for multiple sclerosis, which has an increasing focus on targeting the progressive biology.},

The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products in parallel and sequentially in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments to slow disease progression. Platform trials have considerable operational and statistical efficiencies compared with typical randomized controlled trials due to their use of shared infrastructure and shared control data. We describe the statistical approaches required to achieve the objectives of a platform trial in the context of ALS. This includes following regulatory guidance for the disease area of interest and accounting for potential differences in outcomes of participants within the shared control (potentially due to differences in time of randomization, mode of administration, and eligibility criteria). Within the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, the complex statistical objectives are met using a Bayesian shared parameter analysis of function and survival. This analysis serves to provide a common integrated estimate of treatment benefit, overall slowing in disease progression, as measured by function and survival while accounting for potential differences in the shared control group using Bayesian hierarchical modeling. Clinical trial simulation is used to provide a better understanding of this novel analysis method and complex design. ANN NEUROL 2023;94:547-560.},

	abstract = {During medical image analysis, it is often useful to align (or 'normalize') a given image of a given body part to a representative standard (or 'template') of that body part. The impact that brain templates have had on the analysis of brain images highlights the importance of templates in general. However, templates for human hands do not exist. Image normalization is especially important for hand images because hands, by design, readily change shape during various tasks. Here we report the construction of an anatomical template for healthy adult human hands. To do this, we used 27 anatomically representative T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of either hand from 21 demographically representative healthy adult subjects (13 females and 8 males). We used the open-source, cross-platform ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools) medical image analysis software framework, to preprocess the MR images. The template was constructed using the ANTs standard multivariate template construction workflow. The resulting template image preserved all the essential anatomical features of the hand, including all the individual bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, as well as the main branches of the median nerve and radial, ulnar, and palmar metacarpal arteries. Furthermore, the image quality of the template was significantly higher than that of the underlying individual hand images as measured by two independent canonical metrics of image quality.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The existing tools to quantify lung function in interstitial lung diseases have significant limitations. Lung MRI imaging using inhaled hyperpolarized xenon-129 gas (129Xe) as a contrast agent is a new technology for measuring regional lung physiology. We sought to assess the utility of the 129Xe MRI in detecting impaired lung physiology in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval and informed consent and in compliance with HIPAA regulations, we performed chest CT, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and 129Xe MRI in 10 UIP subjects and 10 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The 129Xe MRI detected highly heterogeneous abnormalities within individual UIP subjects as compared to controls. Subjects with UIP had markedly impaired ventilation (ventilation defect fraction: UIP: 30 $\pm$ 9%; healthy: 21 $\pm$ 9%; p = 0.026), a greater amount of 129Xe dissolved in the lung interstitium (tissue-to-gas ratio: UIP: 1.45 $\pm$ 0.35%; healthy: 1.10 $\pm$ 0.17%; p = 0.014), and impaired 129Xe diffusion into the blood (RBC-to-tissue ratio: UIP: 0.20 $\pm$ 0.06; healthy: 0.28 $\pm$ 0.05; p = 0.004). Most MRI variables had no correlation with the CT and PFT measurements. The elevated level of 129Xe dissolved in the lung interstitium, in particular, was detectable even in subjects with normal or mildly impaired PFTs, suggesting that this measurement may represent a new method for detecting early fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: The hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI was highly sensitive to regional functional changes in subjects with UIP and may represent a new tool for understanding the pathophysiology, monitoring the progression, and assessing the effectiveness of treatment in UIP.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the effect of lung volume on measured values and repeatability of xenon 129 (129Xe) gas uptake metrics in healthy volunteers and participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included data (March 2014-December 2015) from 49 participants (19 with COPD [mean age, 67 years $\pm$ 9 (SD)]; nine women]; 25 older healthy volunteers [mean age, 59 years $\pm$ 10; 20 women]; and five young healthy women [mean age, 23 years $\pm$ 3]). Thirty-two participants underwent repeated 129Xe and same-breath-hold proton MRI at residual volume plus one-third forced vital capacity (RV+FVC/3), with 29 also undergoing one examination at total lung capacity (TLC). The remaining 17 participants underwent imaging at TLC, RV+FVC/3, and residual volume (RV). Signal ratios between membrane, red blood cell (RBC), and gas-phase compartments were calculated using hierarchical iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (ie, IDEAL). Repeatability was assessed using coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient, and volume relationships were assessed using Spearman correlation and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
RESULTS: Gas uptake metrics were repeatable at RV+FVC/3 (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88 for membrane/gas; 0.71 for RBC/gas, and 0.88 for RBC/membrane). Relative ratio changes were highly correlated with relative volume changes for membrane/gas (r = -0.97) and RBC/gas (r = -0.93). Membrane/gas and RBC/gas measured at RV+FVC/3 were significantly lower in the COPD group than the corresponding healthy group (P ≤ .001). However, these differences lessened upon correction for individual volume differences (P = .23 for membrane/gas; P = .09 for RBC/gas).
CONCLUSION: Dissolved-phase 129Xe MRI-derived gas uptake metrics were repeatable but highly dependent on lung volume during measurement.Keywords: Blood-Air Barrier, MRI, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Pulmonary Gas Exchange, Xenon Supplemental material is available for this article {\copyright} RSNA, 2023.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Missing data is a significant challenge in medical research. In longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) where structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is collected from individuals at multiple time points, participants may miss a study visit or drop out. Additionally, technical issues such as participant motion in the scanner may result in unusable imaging data at designated visits. Such missing data may hinder the development of high-quality imaging-based biomarkers. Furthermore, when imaging data are unavailable in clinical practice, patients may not benefit from effective application of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring.
METHODS: To address the problem of missing MRI data in studies of AD, we introduced a novel 3D diffusion model specifically designed for imputing missing structural MRI ( R ecovery of M issing N euroimaging using D iffusion models (ReMiND)). The model generates a whole-brain image conditional on a single structural MRI observed at a past visit or conditional on one past and one future observed structural MRI relative to the missing observation.
RESULTS: Experimental results show that our method can generate highquality individual 3D structural MRI with high similarity to ground truth, observed images. Additionally, images generated using ReMiND exhibit relatively lower error rates and more accurately estimated rates of atrophy over time in important anatomical brain regions compared with two alternative imputation approaches: forward filling and image generation using variational autoencoders.
CONCLUSION: Our 3D diffusion model can impute missing structural MRI data at a single designated visit and outperforms alternative methods for imputing whole-brain images that are missing from longitudinal trajectories.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Research suggests a link between Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS) and the overproduction of amyloid plaques. Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) we can assess the in-vivo regional amyloid load using several available ligands. To measure amyloid distributions in specific brain regions, a brain atlas is used. A popular method of creating a brain atlas is to segment a participant's structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Acquiring an MRI is often challenging in intellectually-imparied populations because of contraindications or data exclusion due to significant motion artifacts or incomplete sequences related to general discomfort. When an MRI cannot be acquired, it is typically replaced with a standardized brain atlas derived from neurotypical populations (i.e. healthy individuals without DS) which may be inappropriate for use in DS. In this project, we create a series of disease and diagnosis-specific (cognitively stable (CS-DS), mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DS), and dementia (DEM-DS)) probabilistic group atlases of participants with DS and evaluate their accuracy of quantifying regional amyloid load compared to the individually-based MRI segmentations. Further, we compare the diagnostic-specific atlases with a probabilistic atlas constructed from similar-aged cognitively-stable neurotypical participants. We hypothesized that regional PET signals will best match the individually-based MRI segmentations by using DS group atlases that aligns with a participant's disorder and disease status (e.g. DS and MCI-DS). Our results vary by brain region but generally show that using a disorder-specific atlas in DS better matches the individually-based MRI segmentations than using an atlas constructed from cognitively-stable neurotypical participants. We found no additional benefit of using diagnose-specific atlases matching disease status. All atlases are made publicly available for the research community.
HIGHLIGHT: Down syndrome (DS) joint-label-fusion atlases provide accurate positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid measurements.A disorder-specific DS atlas is better than a neurotypical atlas for PET quantification.It is not necessary to use a disease-state-specific atlas for quantification in aged DS.Dorsal striatum results vary, possibly due to this region and dementia progression.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Feature selection is one of the main challenges in analyzing high-throughput genomic data. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is a particularly fast feature selection method for finding a set of both relevant and complementary features. Here we describe the mRMRe R package, in which the mRMR technique is extended by using an ensemble approach to better explore the feature space and build more robust predictors. To deal with the computational complexity of the ensemble approach, the main functions of the package are implemented and parallelized in C using the openMP Application Programming Interface.
RESULTS: Our ensemble mRMR implementations outperform the classical mRMR approach in terms of prediction accuracy. They identify genes more relevant to the biological context and may lead to richer biological interpretations. The parallelized functions included in the package show significant gains in terms of run-time speed when compared with previously released packages.
AVAILABILITY: The R package mRMRe is available on Comprehensive R Archive Network and is provided open source under the Artistic-2.0 License. The code used to generate all the results reported in this application note is available from Supplementary File 1.

@article{Henneman:2009vk,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the added value of hippocampal atrophy rates over whole brain volume measurements on MRI in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls.
METHODS: We included 64 patients with AD (67 +/- 9 years; F/M 38/26), 44 patients with MCI (71 +/- 6 years; 21/23), and 34 controls (67 +/- 9 years; 16/18). Two MR scans were performed (scan interval: 1.8 +/- 0.7 years; 1.0 T), using a coronal three-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo sequence. At follow-up, 3 controls and 23 patients with MCI had progressed to AD. Hippocampi were manually delineated at baseline. Hippocampal atrophy rates were calculated using regional, nonlinear fluid registration. Whole brain baseline volumes and atrophy rates were determined using automated segmentation and registration tools.
RESULTS: All MRI measures differed between groups (p < 0.005). For the distinction of MCI from controls, larger effect sizes of hippocampal measures were found compared to whole brain measures. Between MCI and AD, only whole brain atrophy rate differed significantly. Cox proportional hazards models (variables dichotomized by median) showed that within all patients without dementia, hippocampal baseline volume (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.7 [95% confidence interval: 1.5-22.2]), hippocampal atrophy rate (5.2 [1.9-14.3]), and whole brain atrophy rate (2.8 [1.1-7.2]) independently predicted progression to AD; the combination of low hippocampal volume and high atrophy rate yielded a HR of 61.1 (6.1-606.8). Within patients with MCI, only hippocampal baseline volume and atrophy rate predicted progression.
CONCLUSION: Hippocampal measures, especially hippocampal atrophy rate, best discriminate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from controls. Whole brain atrophy rate discriminates Alzheimer disease (AD) from MCI. Regional measures of hippocampal atrophy are the strongest predictors of progression to AD.},

A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is reported.},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

@article{Ding:2022tk,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proposed methods of minimally invasive and robot-assisted procedures within the temporal bone require measurements of surgically relevant distances and angles, which often require time-consuming manual segmentation of preoperative imaging. This study aims to describe an automatic segmentation and measurement extraction pipeline of temporal bone cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scans.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study of temporal bone measurements.
SETTING: Academic institution.
METHODS: A propagation template composed of 16 temporal bone CT scans was formed with relevant anatomical structures and landmarks manually segmented. Next, 52 temporal bone CT scans were autonomously segmented using deformable registration techniques from the Advanced Normalization Tools Python package. Anatomical measurements were extracted via in-house Python algorithms. Extracted measurements were compared to ground truth values from manual segmentations.
RESULTS: Paired t test analyses showed no statistical difference between measurements using this pipeline and ground truth measurements from manually segmented images. Mean (SD) malleus manubrium length was 4.39 (0.34) mm. Mean (SD) incus short and long processes were 2.91 (0.18) mm and 3.53 (0.38) mm, respectively. The mean (SD) maximal diameter of the incus long process was 0.74 (0.17) mm. The first and second facial nerve genus had mean (SD) angles of 68.6 (6.7) degrees and 111.1 (5.3) degrees, respectively. The facial recess had a mean (SD) span of 3.21 (0.46) mm. Mean (SD) minimum distance between the external auditory canal and tegmen was 3.79 (1.05) mm.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to automatically extract relevant temporal bone anatomical measurements from CT scans using segmentation propagation. Measurements from these models can streamline preoperative planning, improve future segmentation techniques, and help develop future image-guided or robot-assisted systems for temporal bone procedures.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is an established, independent, strong predictor of surgical outcome in refractory epilepsy. In this study, we explored the added value of quantitative [18F]FDG-PET features combined with clinical variables, including electroencephalography (EEG), [18F]FDG-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) qualitative interpretations, to predict long-term seizure recurrence (mean post-op follow-up of 5.85 $\pm$ 3.77 years).
METHODS: Machine learning predictive models of surgical outcome were created using a random forest classifier trained on quantitative features in 89 patients with drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy evaluated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania epilepsy surgery program (2003-2016). Quantitative features were calculated from asymmetry features derived from image processing using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).
RESULTS: The best-performing model used quantification and had an out-of-bag accuracy of 0.71 in identifying patients with seizure recurrence (Engel IB or worse) which outperformed that using qualitative clinical data by 10%. This model is shared through open-source software for research use. In addition, several asymmetry features in temporal and extratemporal regions that were significantly associated with seizure freedom are identified for future study.
SIGNIFICANCE: Complex quantitative [18F]FDG-PET imaging features can predict seizure recurrence in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. These initial retrospective results in a cohort with long-term follow-up suggest that using quantitative imaging features from regions in the epileptogenic network can inform the clinical decision-making process.},

	abstract = {Due to the complexity of fish skulls, previous attempts to classify craniofacial phenotypes have relied on qualitative features or sparce 2D landmarks. In this work we aim to identify previously unknown 3D craniofacial phenotypes with a semiautomated pipeline in adult zebrafish mutants. We first estimate a synthetic 'normative' zebrafish template using MicroCT scans from a sample pool of wild-type animals using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We apply a computational anatomy (CA) approach to quantify the phenotype of zebrafish with disruptions in bmp1a, a gene implicated in later skeletal development and whose human ortholog when disrupted is associated with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Compared to controls, the bmp1a fish have larger otoliths, larger normalized centroid sizes, and exhibit shape differences concentrated around the operculum, anterior frontal, and posterior parietal bones. Moreover, bmp1a fish differ in the degree of asymmetry. Our CA approach offers a potential pipeline for high-throughput screening of complex fish craniofacial shape to discover novel phenotypes for which traditional landmarks are too sparce to detect. The current pipeline successfully identifies areas of variation in zebrafish mutants, which are an important model system for testing genome to phenome relationships in the study of development, evolution, and human diseases.

	abstract = {The amygdala is composed of multiple nuclei with unique functions and connections in the limbic system and to the rest of the brain. However, standard in vivo neuroimaging tools to automatically delineate the amygdala into its multiple nuclei are still rare. By scanning postmortem specimens at high resolution (100-150µm) at 7T field strength (n = 10), we were able to visualize and label nine amygdala nuclei (anterior amygdaloid, cortico-amygdaloid transition area; basal, lateral, accessory basal, central, cortical medial, paralaminar nuclei). We created an atlas from these labels using a recently developed atlas building algorithm based on Bayesian inference. This atlas, which will be released as part of FreeSurfer, can be used to automatically segment nine amygdala nuclei from a standard resolution structural MR image. We applied this atlas to two publicly available datasets (ADNI and ABIDE) with standard resolution T1 data, used individual volumetric data of the amygdala nuclei as the measure and found that our atlas i) discriminates between Alzheimer's disease participants and age-matched control participants with 84% accuracy (AUC=0.915), and ii) discriminates between individuals with autism and age-, sex- and IQ-matched neurotypically developed control participants with 59.5% accuracy (AUC=0.59). For both datasets, the new ex vivo atlas significantly outperformed (all p < .05) estimations of the whole amygdala derived from the segmentation in FreeSurfer 5.1 (ADNI: 75%, ABIDE: 54% accuracy), as well as classification based on whole amygdala volume (using the sum of all amygdala nuclei volumes; ADNI: 81%, ABIDE: 55% accuracy). This new atlas and the segmentation tools that utilize it will provide neuroimaging researchers with the ability to explore the function and connectivity of the human amygdala nuclei with unprecedented detail in healthy adults as well as those with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.},

	abstract = {There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-191-13. However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51-81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans-with 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan-as well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.},

@article{Patenaude:2011vy,
	abstract = {Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package.},

@article{Zhang:2001ve,
	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

	abstract = {Spin-echo-based acquisitions are the workhorse of clinical MRI because they provide a variety of useful image contrasts and are resistant to image artifacts from radio-frequency or static field inhomogeneity. Three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions provide datasets that can be retrospectively reformatted for viewing in freely selectable orientations, and are thus advantageous for evaluating the complex anatomy associated with many clinical applications of MRI. Historically, however, 3D spin-echo-based acquisitions have not played a significant role in clinical MRI due to unacceptably long acquisition times or image artifacts associated with details of the acquisition method. Recently, optimized forms of 3D fast/turbo spin-echo imaging have become available from several MR-equipment manufacturers (for example, CUBE [GE], SPACE [Siemens], and VISTA [Philips]). Through specific design strategies and optimization, including short non-spatially selective radio-frequency pulses to significantly shorten the echo spacing and variable flip angles for the refocusing radio-frequency pulses to suppress blurring or considerably lengthen the useable duration of the spin-echo train, these techniques permit single-slab 3D imaging of sizeable volumes in clinically acceptable acquisition times. These optimized fast/turbo spin-echo pulse sequences provide a robust and flexible approach for 3D spin-echo-based imaging with a broad range of clinical applications.},

We used linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring to test for shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders and physical health. Using information provided by many published genome-wide association study consortia, we created polygenic profile scores for 24 vascular-metabolic, neuropsychiatric, physiological-anthropometric and cognitive traits in the participants of UK Biobank, a very large population-based sample (N=112 151). Pleiotropy between cognitive and health traits was quantified by deriving genetic correlations using summary genome-wide association study statistics and to the method of linkage disequilibrium score regression. Substantial and significant genetic correlations were observed between cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many of the mental and physical health-related traits and disorders assessed here. In addition, highly significant associations were observed between the cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many polygenic profile scores, including coronary artery disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder, body mass index, intracranial volume, infant head circumference and childhood cognitive ability. Where disease diagnosis was available for UK Biobank participants, we were able to show that these results were not confounded by those who had the relevant disease. These findings indicate that a substantial level of pleiotropy exists between cognitive abilities and many human mental and physical health disorders and traits and that it can be used to predict phenotypic variance across samples.},

The modes represent different aspects of brain aging, showing distinct patterns of functional and structural brain change, and distinct patterns of association with genetics, lifestyle, cognition, physical measures and disease. While conventional brain-age modelling found no genetic associations, 34 modes had genetic associations.

	abstract = {Few neuroimaging studies are sufficiently large to adequately describe population-wide variations. This study's primary aim was to generate neuroanatomical norms and individual markers that consider age, sex, and brain size, from 629 cerebral measures in the UK Biobank (N = 40,028). The secondary aim was to examine the effects and interactions of sex, age, and brain allometry-the nonlinear scaling relationship between a region and brain size (e.g., total brain volume)-across cerebral measures. Allometry was a common property of brain volumes, thicknesses, and surface areas (83%) and was largely stable across age and sex. Sex differences occurred in 67% of cerebral measures (median |β| = .13): 37% of regions were larger in males and 30% in females. Brain measures (49%) generally decreased with age, although aging effects varied across regions and sexes. While models with an allometric or linear covariate adjustment for brain size yielded similar significant effects, omitting brain allometry influenced reported sex differences in variance. Finally, we contribute to the reproducibility of research on sex differences in the brain by replicating previous studies examining cerebral sex differences. This large-scale study advances our understanding of age, sex, and brain allometry's impact on brain structure and provides data for future UK Biobank studies to identify the cerebral regions that covary with specific phenotypes, independently of sex, age, and brain size.},

Previously, we published genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a discovery sample of 8,428 individuals. Here we present a new open resource of genome-wide association study summary statistics, using the 2020 data release, almost tripling the discovery sample size. We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial disorders.},

	abstract = {Measurement of hippocampal volume has proven useful to diagnose and track progression in several brain disorders, most notably in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, an objective evaluation of a patient's hippocampal volume status may provide important information that can assist diagnosis or risk stratification of AD. However, clinicians and researchers require access to age-related normative percentiles to reliably categorise a patient's hippocampal volume as being pathologically small. Here we analysed effects of age, sex, and hemisphere on the hippocampus and neighbouring temporal lobe volumes, in 19,793 generally healthy participants in the UK Biobank. A key finding of the current study is a significant acceleration in the rate of hippocampal volume loss in middle age, more pronounced in females than in males. In this report, we provide normative values for hippocampal and total grey matter volume as a function of age for reference in clinical and research settings. These normative values may be used in combination with our online, automated percentile estimation tool to provide a rapid, objective evaluation of an individual's hippocampal volume status. The data provide a large-scale normative database to facilitate easy age-adjusted determination of where an individual hippocampal and temporal lobe volume lies within the normal distribution.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Even though seasonal and sex-dependent changes in hippocampal and subfield volumes are well known in animals, little is known about changes in humans. We hypothesized that changes in photoperiod would predict changes in hippocampal subfield volumes and that this association would be different between females and males.
METHODS: A total of 10,033 participants ranging in age from 45 to 79 years were scanned by MRI in a single location as part of the UK Biobank project. Hippocampal subfield volumes were obtained using automated processing and segmentation algorithms using the developmental version of the FreeSurfer v 6.0. Photoperiod was defined as the number of hours between sunrise and sunset on the day of scan.
RESULTS: Photoperiod correlated positively with total hippocampal volume and all subfield volumes across participants as well as in each sex individually, with females showing greater seasonal variation in a majority of left subfield volumes compared with males. ANCOVAs revealed significant differences in rate of change in only left subiculum, CA-4, and GC-ML-DG between females and males. PLS showed highest loadings of hippocampal subfields in both females and males in GC-ML-DG, CA1, CA4, subiculum, and CA3 for left hemisphere and CA1, GC-ML-DG, CA4; subiculum and CA3 for right hemisphere in females; GC-ML-DG, CA1, subiculum, CA4 and CA3 for left hemisphere; CA1, GC-ML-DG, subiculum, CA4 and CA3 for right hemisphere in males.
CONCLUSION: The influence of day length on hippocampal volume has implications for modeling age-related decline in memory in older adults, and sex differences suggest an important role for hormones in these effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is important for memory processing. Several neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease are associated with reduced hippocampal volume, and further the hippocampus appears vulnerable to environmental insult. Air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular disease, abnormal brain structure, and cognitive deficits.
OBJECTIVE: Because of hippocampal vulnerability to environmental insults and based on the association between exposure to air pollution and cognitive function and brain structure, we evaluated the association between exposure to toxins in air pollution and left and right hippocampal volume using brain-imaging and air-pollution data from the UK Biobank, a large community-based dataset.
METHODS: We used regression modelling to evaluate the association between exposure to nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides, PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10. and left and right hippocampal volume controlling for age, sex, body-mass index, overall health, alcohol use, smoking, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, inverse distance from the nearest major road, and a measure of total brain volume.
RESULTS: In these models, PM2.5 concentration was associated with smaller left hippocampal volume. None of the other measures of air pollution was associated with either left or right hippocampal volume, although interaction models provided some evidence that sex might moderate the relationship between air pollution and hippocampal volume. In adjusted models, age, sex, educational attainment, income, overall health, current smoking, alcohol intake, and body-mass index were associated with hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 at levels found in the United Kingdom was associated with smaller left hippocampal volume. Additional associations between several covariates and hippocampal volumes indicate that hippocampal volume might be associated with several potentially modifiable variables.},

Studies have used datasets sampled from patients admitted to hospital, people tested for active infection, or people who volunteered to participate. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such non-representative samples. Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled, distorting associations between these variables in the sample. Analysing UK Biobank data, compared to the wider cohort the participants tested for COVID-19 were highly selected for a range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the mechanisms inducing these problems, and approaches that could help mitigate them. While collider bias should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P < 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity.

In this study, we aimed to provide a shared foundation for UKB neuroimaging research into mental health with a focus on anxiety and depression. We compared UKB self-report measures and revealed important timing effects between scan acquisition and separate online acquisition of some mental health measures. To overcome these timing effects, we introduced and validated the Recent Depressive Symptoms (RDS-4) score which we recommend for state-dependent and longitudinal research in the UKB. We furthermore tested univariate and multivariate associations between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and mental health. Our results showed a significant multivariate relationship between IDPs and mental health, which was replicable. Conversely, effect sizes for individual IDPs were small. Test-retest reliability of IDPs was stronger for measures of brain structure than for measures of brain function. Taken together, these results provide benchmarks and guidelines for future UKB research into brain biomarkers of mental health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological aging is revealed by physical measures, e.g., DNA probes or brain scans. In contrast, individual differences in mental function are explained by psychological constructs, e.g., intelligence or neuroticism. These constructs are typically assessed by tailored neuropsychological tests that build on expert judgement and require careful interpretation. Could machine learning on large samples from the general population be used to build proxy measures of these constructs that do not require human intervention?
RESULTS: Here, we built proxy measures by applying machine learning on multimodal MR images and rich sociodemographic information from the largest biomedical cohort to date: the UK Biobank. Objective model comparisons revealed that all proxies captured the target constructs and were as useful, and sometimes more useful, than the original measures for characterizing real-world health behavior (sleep, exercise, tobacco, alcohol consumption). We observed this complementarity of proxy measures and original measures at capturing multiple health-related constructs when modeling from, both, brain signals and sociodemographic data.
CONCLUSION: Population modeling with machine learning can derive measures of mental health from heterogeneous inputs including brain signals and questionnaire data. This may complement or even substitute for psychometric assessments in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Age-related cognitive decline is a well-known phenomenon after age 65 but little is known about earlier changes and prior studies are based on relatively small samples. We investigated the impact of age on cognitive decline in the largest population sample to date including young to old adults.
METHOD: Between 100,352 and 468,534 participants aged 38-73 years from UK Biobank completed at least one of seven self-administered cognitive functioning tests: prospective memory (PM), pairs matching (Pairs), fluid intelligence (FI), reaction time (RT), symbol digit substitution, trail making A and B. Up to 26,005 participants completed at least one of two follow-up assessments of PM, Pairs, FI and RT. Multivariable regression models examined the association between age (<45[reference], 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65+) and cognition scores at baseline. Mixed models estimated the impact of age on cognitive decline over follow-up (~5.1 years).
RESULTS: FI was higher between ages 50 and 64 and lower at 65+ compared to <45 at baseline. Performance on all other baseline tests was lower with older age: with increasing age category, difference in test scores ranged from 2.5 to 7.8%(P<0.0001). Compared to <45 at baseline, RT and Pairs performance declined faster across all older age cohorts (3.0 and 1.2% change, respectively, with increasing age category, P<0.0001). Cross-sectional results yielded 8 to 12-fold higher differences in RT and Pairs with age compared to longitudinal results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that declines in cognitive abilities <65 are small. The cross-sectional differences in cognition scores for middle to older adult years may be due in part to age cohort effects.},

Multiorgan MRI can provide further insight on the repercussions of COVID-19 on organ health but requires a balance between richness and quality of data acquisition and total scan duration. We adapted the UK Biobank brain MRI protocol to produce high-quality images while being suitable as part of a post-COVID-19 multiorgan MRI exam. The analysis pipeline, also adapted from UK Biobank, includes new imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) designed to assess the possible effects of COVID-19. A first application of the protocol and pipeline was performed in 51 COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 25 controls participating in the Oxford C-MORE study. The protocol acquires high resolution T1, T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted images, susceptibility weighted images, and arterial spin labelling data in 17 min. The automated imaging pipeline derives 1,575 IDPs, assessing brain anatomy (including olfactory bulb volume and intensity) and tissue perfusion, hyperintensities, diffusivity, and susceptibility. In the C-MORE data, IDPs related to atrophy, small vessel disease and olfactory bulbs were consistent with clinical radiology reports. Our exploratory analysis tentatively revealed some group differences between recovered COVID-19 patients and controls, across severity groups, but not across anosmia groups.

	abstract = {Newer approaches to characterizing hippocampal morphology can provide novel insights regarding cognitive function across the lifespan. We comprehensively assessed the relationships among age, hippocampal morphology, and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in 137 healthy individuals across the adult lifespan (18-86 years of age). They underwent MRI, cognitive assessments and genotyping for Apolipoprotein E status. We measured hippocampal subfield volumes using a new multiatlas segmentation tool (MAGeT-Brain) and assessed vertex-wise (inward and outward displacements) and global surface-based descriptions of hippocampus morphology. We examined the effects of age on hippocampal morphology, as well as the relationship among age, hippocampal morphology, and episodic and working memory performance. Age and volume were modestly correlated across hippocampal subfields. Significant patterns of inward and outward displacement in hippocampal head and tail were associated with age. The first principal shape component of the left hippocampus, characterized by a lengthening of the antero-posterior axis was prominently associated with working memory performance across the adult lifespan. In contrast, no significant relationships were found among subfield volumes and cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that hippocampal shape plays a unique and important role in hippocampal-dependent cognitive aging across the adult lifespan, meriting consideration as a biomarker in strategies targeting the delay of cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {The study of the hippocampus across the healthy adult lifespan has rendered inconsistent findings. While volumetric measurements have often been a popular technique for analysis, more advanced morphometric techniques have demonstrated compelling results that highlight the importance and improved specificity of shape-based measures. Here, the MAGeT Brain algorithm was applied on 134 healthy individuals aged 18-81 years old to extract hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal shape measurements, namely: local surface area (SA) and displacement. We used linear-, second- or third-order natural splines to examine the relationships between hippocampal measures and age. In addition, partial least squares analyses were performed to relate volume and shape measurements with cognitive and demographic information. Volumetric results indicated a relative preservation of the right cornus ammonis 1 with age and a global volume reduction linked with older age, female sex, lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Vertex-wise analysis demonstrated an SA preservation in the anterior hippocampus with a peak during the sixth decade, while the posterior hippocampal SA gradually decreased across lifespan. Overall, SA decrease was linked to older age, female sex and, to a lesser extent lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Outward displacement in the lateral hippocampus and inward displacement in the medial hippocampus were enlarged with older age, lower levels of cognition and education, indicating an accentuation of the hippocampal "C" shape with age. Taken together, our findings suggest that vertex-wise analyses have higher spatial specifity and that sex, education, and cognition are implicated in the differential impact of age on hippocampal subregions throughout its anteroposterior and medial-lateral axes.

	abstract = {Reliable quantification of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMHs) is increasingly needed, given the presence of these MRI findings in patients with several neurological and vascular disorders, as well as in elderly healthy subjects. We present BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm), a fully automated, supervised method for WMH detection, based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. Relative to previous k-NN based segmentation methods, BIANCA offers different options for weighting the spatial information, local spatial intensity averaging, and different options for the choice of the number and location of the training points. BIANCA is multimodal and highly flexible so that the user can adapt the tool to their protocol and specific needs. We optimised and validated BIANCA on two datasets with different MRI protocols and patient populations (a "predominantly neurodegenerative" and a "predominantly vascular" cohort). BIANCA was first optimised on a subset of images for each dataset in terms of overlap and volumetric agreement with a manually segmented WMH mask. The correlation between the volumes extracted with BIANCA (using the optimised set of options), the volumes extracted from the manual masks and visual ratings showed that BIANCA is a valid alternative to manual segmentation. The optimised set of options was then applied to the whole cohorts and the resulting WMH volume estimates showed good correlations with visual ratings and with age. Finally, we performed a reproducibility test, to evaluate the robustness of BIANCA, and compared BIANCA performance against existing methods. Our findings suggest that BIANCA, which will be freely available as part of the FSL package, is a reliable method for automated WMH segmentation in large cross-sectional cohort studies. },

	abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

@article{Desikan:2006ui,
	abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

	abstract = {Quantification of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological research studies. Currently, measurements are often still obtained from manual segmentations on brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure. The automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their methods on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge. Sixty T1 + FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with the manual WMH segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was used for evaluation. The segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the methods: 1) Dice similarity coefficient; 2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile); 3) absolute log-transformed volume difference; 4) sensitivity for detecting individual lesions; and 5) F1-score for individual lesions. In addition, the methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness; 20 participants submitted their methods for evaluation. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all the methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public platform for method evaluation.},

The algorithm was evaluated and ranked 1st in the WMH Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2017. In the evaluation stage, the implementation of the algorithm was submitted to the challenge organizers, who then independently tested it on a hidden set of 110 cases from 5 scanners. Averaged dice score, precision and robust Hausdorff distance obtained on held-out test datasets were 80%, 84% and 6.30 mm respectively. These were the highest achieved in the challenge, suggesting the proposed method is the state-of-the-art. Detailed descriptions and quantitative analysis on key components of the system were provided. Furthermore, a study of cross-scanner evaluation is presented to discuss how the combination of modalities affect the generalization capability of the system. The adaptability of the system to different scanners and protocols is also investigated. A quantitative study is further presented to show the effect of ensemble size and the effectiveness of the ensemble model. Additionally, software and models of our method are made publicly available.

@article{Tustison:2019ac,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

	abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	abstract = {Objective: It is well-known that the hippocampus presents significant asymmetry in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that difference in volumes between left and right exists and varies with disease progression. However, few works investigated whether the asymmetry degree of subfields of hippocampus changes through the continuum from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Thus, aim of the present work was to evaluate the Asymmetry Index (AI) of hippocampal substructures as possible MRI biomarkers of Dementia. Moreover, we aimed to assess whether the subfields presented peculiar differences between left and right hemispheres. We also investigated the relationship between the asymmetry magnitude in hippocampal subfields and the decline of verbal memory as assessed by Rey's auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). Methods: Four-hundred subjects were selected from ADNI, equally divided into healthy controls (HC), AD, stable MCI (sMCI), and progressive MCI (pMCI). The structural baseline T1s were processed with FreeSurfer 6.0 and volumes of whole hippocampus (WH) and 12 subfields were extracted. The AI was calculated as: (|Left-Right|/(Left+Right))*100. ANCOVA was used for evaluating AI differences between diagnoses, while paired t-test was applied for assessing changes between left and right volumes, separately for each group. Partial correlation was performed for exploring relationship between RAVLT summary scores (Immediate, Learning, Forgetting, Percent Forgetting) and hippocampal substructures AI. The statistical threshold was Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05/13 = 0.0038. Results: We found a general trend of increased degree of asymmetry with increasing severity of diagnosis. Indeed, AD presented the higher magnitude of asymmetry compared with HC, sMCI and pMCI, in the WH (AI mean 5.13 $\pm$ 4.29 SD) and in each of its twelve subfields. Moreover, we found in AD a significant negative correlation (r = -0.33, p = 0.00065) between the AI of parasubiculum (mean 12.70 $\pm$ 9.59 SD) and the RAVLT Learning score (mean 1.70 $\pm$ 1.62 SD). Conclusions: Our findings showed that hippocampal subfields AI varies differently among the four groups HC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. Moreover, we found-for the first time-that hippocampal substructures had different sub-patterns of lateralization compared with the whole hippocampus. Importantly, the severity in learning rate was correlated with pathological high degree of asymmetry in parasubiculum of AD patients.},

	abstract = {Hemispheric asymmetry of hippocampal volume is a common finding that has biological relevance, including associations with dementia and cognitive performance. However, a recent study has reported the possibility of systematic error in measurements of hippocampal asymmetry by magnetic resonance volumetry. We manually traced the volumes of the anterior and posterior hippocampus in 40 healthy people to measure systematic error related to image orientation. We found a bias due to the side of the screen on which the hippocampus was viewed, such that hippocampal volume was larger when traced on the left side of the screen than when traced on the right (p = 0.05). However, this bias was smaller than the anatomical right > left asymmetry of the anterior hippocampus. We found right > left asymmetry of hippocampal volume regardless of image presentation (radiological versus neurological). We conclude that manual segmentation protocols can minimize the effect of image orientation in the study of hippocampal volume asymmetry, but our confirmation that such bias exists suggests strategies to avoid it in future studies.},

@article{Thompson:2009tr,
	abstract = {Hippocampi are asymmetrical in children and adults, where the right hippocampus is larger. To date, no literature has confirmed that hippocampal asymmetry is evident at birth. Furthermore, gender differences have been observed in normal hippocampal asymmetry, but this has not been examined in neonates. Stress, injury, and lower IQ have been associated with alterations to hippocampal asymmetry. These same factors often accompany preterm birth. Therefore, prematurity is possibly associated with altered hippocampal asymmetry. There were three aims of this study: First, we assessed whether hippocampi were asymmetrical at birth, second whether there was a gender effect on hippocampal asymmetry, and third whether the stress of preterm birth altered hippocampal asymmetry. This study utilized volumetric magnetic resonance imaging to compare left and right hippocampal volumes in 32 full-term and 184 preterm infants at term. Full-term infants demonstrated rightward hippocampal asymmetry, as did preterm infants. In the case of preterm infants, hippocampal asymmetry was proportional to total hemispheric asymmetry. This study is the first to demonstrate that the normal pattern of hippocampal asymmetry is present this early in development. We did not find gender differences in hippocampal asymmetry at term. Preterm infants tended to have less asymmetrical hippocampi than full-term infants, a difference which became significant after correcting for hemispheric brain tissue volumes. This study may suggest that hippocampal asymmetry develops in utero and is maintained into adulthood in infants with a normal neurological course.},

@article{Tustison:2009vn,
	abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},

	abstract = {The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI causes many difficulties in image display and analysis. A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P < 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

@article{Tustison:2021ab,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize the differences between histogram-based and image-based algorithms for segmentation of hyperpolarized gas lung images.
METHODS: Four previously published histogram-based segmentation algorithms (ie, linear binning, hierarchical k-means, fuzzy spatial c-means, and a Gaussian mixture model with a Markov random field prior) and an image-based convolutional neural network were used to segment 2 simulated data sets derived from a public (n = 29 subjects) and a retrospective collection (n = 51 subjects) of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas lung images transformed by common MRI artifacts (noise and nonlinear intensity distortion). The resulting ventilation-based segmentations were used to assess algorithmic performance and characterize optimization domain differences in terms of measurement bias and precision.
RESULTS: Although facilitating computational processing and providing discriminating clinically relevant measures of interest, histogram-based segmentation methods discard important contextual spatial information and are consequently less robust in terms of measurement precision in the presence of common MRI artifacts relative to the image-based convolutional neural network.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct optimization within the image domain using convolutional neural networks leverages spatial information, which mitigates problematic issues associated with histogram-based approaches and suggests a preferred future research direction. Further, the entire processing and evaluation framework, including the newly reported deep learning functionality, is available as open source through the well-known Advanced Normalization Tools ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package--a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

	abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

	abstract = {Aging is often accompanied by learning and memory problems, many of which resemble deficits associated with hippocampal damage. Studies of aging in nonhuman animals have demonstrated hippocampus-related memory decline, and point to a possible locus for impairments associated with normal and pathological aging in humans. Two well-characterized hippocampus-dependent tasks in nonhuman animal literature are the Morris water task (MWT) and the transverse patterning discrimination task (TPDT). We employed the virtual MWT and the TPDT to assess hippocampus-dependent cognition in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were employed to measure hippocampal volume and neurochemistry respectively. Age-related deficits were observed in performance on both hippocampus-dependent tasks. This pattern of impairment was accompanied by decreased hippocampal NAA/Cre ratios and volume, both of which imply neuronal loss and/or decrease in neuronal density. Collectively, our results suggest that hippocampus undergoes structural and biochemical changes with normal aging and that these changes may represent an important component of age-related deterioration in hippocampus-dependent cognition.},

@article{Zavaliangos-Petropulu:2022aa,
	abstract = {As stroke mortality rates decrease, there has been a surge of effort to study poststroke dementia (PSD) to improve long-term quality of life for stroke survivors. Hippocampal volume may be an important neuroimaging biomarker in poststroke dementia, as it has been associated with many other forms of dementia. However, studying hippocampal volume using MRI requires hippocampal segmentation. Advances in automated segmentation methods have allowed for studying the hippocampus on a large scale, which is important for robust results in the heterogeneous stroke population. However, most of these automated methods use a single atlas-based approach and may fail in the presence of severe structural abnormalities common in stroke. Hippodeep, a new convolutional neural network-based hippocampal segmentation method, does not rely solely on a single atlas-based approach and thus may be better suited for stroke populations. Here, we compared quality control and the accuracy of segmentations generated by Hippodeep and two well-accepted hippocampal segmentation methods on stroke MRIs (FreeSurfer 6.0 whole hippocampus and FreeSurfer 6.0 sum of hippocampal subfields). Quality control was performed using a stringent protocol for visual inspection of the segmentations, and accuracy was measured as volumetric correlation with manual segmentations. Hippodeep performed significantly better than both FreeSurfer methods in terms of quality control. All three automated segmentation methods had good correlation with manual segmentations and no one method was significantly more correlated than the others. Overall, this study suggests that both Hippodeep and FreeSurfer may be useful for hippocampal segmentation in stroke rehabilitation research, but Hippodeep may be more robust to stroke lesion anatomy.},

	abstract = {Medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures are the earliest regions affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology-and thus are promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, automatic segmentation of the MTL using only T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to the large anatomical variability of the MTL cortex and the confound of the dura mater, which is commonly segmented as gray matter by state-of-the-art algorithms because they have similar intensity in T1w MRI. To address these challenges, we developed a novel atlas set, consisting of 15 cognitively normal older adults and 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment with a label explicitly assigned to the dura, that can be used by the multiatlas automated pipeline (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields [ASHS-T1]) for the segmentation of MTL subregions, including anterior/posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, and parahippocampal cortex on T1w MRI. Cross-validation experiments indicated good segmentation accuracy of ASHS-T1 and that the dura can be reliably separated from the cortex (6.5% mislabeled as gray matter). Conversely, FreeSurfer segmented majority of the dura mater (62.4%) as gray matter and the degree of dura mislabeling decreased with increasing disease severity. To evaluate its clinical utility, we applied the pipeline to T1w images of 663 ADNI subjects and significant volume/thickness loss is observed in BA35, ERC, and posterior hippocampus in early prodromal AD and all subregions at later stages. As such, the publicly available new atlas and ASHS-T1 could have important utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD and enhancing brain-behavior studies of these regions.},

	abstract = {The advent of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled in vivo research in a variety of populations and diseases on the structure and function of hippocampal subfields and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols, comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an international collaboration with the aim of developing a harmonized protocol for manual segmentation of hippocampal and parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the associated key challenges involved in its development. These include differences among existing anatomical reference materials, striking the right balance between reliability of measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each, with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once completed, is expected to impact the field by producing measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different studies. {\copyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Spurred by availability of automatic segmentation software, in vivo MRI investigations of human hippocampal subfield volumes have proliferated in the recent years. However, a majority of these studies apply automatic segmentation to MRI scans with approximately 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 resolution, a resolution at which the internal structure of the hippocampus can rarely be visualized. Many of these studies have reported contradictory and often neurobiologically surprising results pertaining to the involvement of hippocampal subfields in normal brain function, aging, and disease. In this commentary, we first outline our concerns regarding the utility and validity of subfield segmentation on 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 MRI for volumetric studies, regardless of how images are segmented (i.e., manually or automatically). This image resolution is generally insufficient for visualizing the internal structure of the hippocampus, particularly the stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare, which is crucial for valid and reliable subfield segmentation. Second, we discuss the fact that automatic methods that are employed most frequently to obtain hippocampal subfield volumes from 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 MRI have not been validated against manual segmentation on such images. For these reasons, we caution against using volumetric measurements of hippocampal subfields obtained from 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 images.},

Assessing hippocampal volumes manually is a time-consuming procedure, however, creating a need for automated segmentation methods that are both fast and reliable over time. Segmentation algorithms that employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as a promising solution for large longitudinal neuroimaging studies. However, for these novel algorithms to be useful in clinical studies, the accuracy and reproducibility should be established on independent datasets. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN-based hippocampal segmentation algorithm that was developed by Thyreau and colleagues - Hippodeep. We compared its segmentation outputs to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer 6.0 in a sample of 200 healthy participants scanned repeatedly at seven sites across Canada, as part of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression consortium. The algorithm demonstrated high levels of stability and reproducibility of volumetric measures across all time points compared to the other two techniques. Although more rigorous testing in clinical populations is necessary, this approach holds promise as a viable option for tracking volumetric changes in longitudinal neuroimaging studies.},

In this study, we assessed correlations between volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala and full-scale IQ scores (FSIQ) using a method of image analysis that permits detailed regional mapping of this correlation throughout the surface contour of these brain structures. We delineated the hippocampus and amygdala in high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the brain from 34 healthy individuals. We then correlated FSIQ with overall volumes and with the surface morphologies of each of these structures. Hippocampus volumes correlated significantly and inversely with FSIQ independently of gender, age, socioeconomic status, and whole brain volume. Left and right hippocampus volumes correlated respectively with verbal and performance IQ subscales. Higher IQs were significantly associated with large inward deformations of the surface of the anterior hippocampus bilaterally. These findings suggest that a smaller anterior hippocampus contributes to an increased efficiency of neural processing that subserves overall intelligence.},

Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the well-known SyN algorithm (Avants et al., 2008), implemented within the same framework, and its B-spline analog is performed using open labeled brain data and open source evaluation tools.},

	abstract = {Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol on a 3-T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition (~1-5% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher (~<10%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures (ASL exhibited variation of 28% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

In large human cohort studies, bilateral hippocampal structures are frequently identified and measured to gain insight into human behaviour or genomic variability in neuropsychiatric disorders of interest. Automatic segmentation is performed using various algorithms, with FreeSurfer being a popular option. In this manuscript, we present a method to segment the bilateral hippocampus using a deep-learned appearance model. Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have shown great success in recent years, due to their ability to learn meaningful features from a mass of training data. Our method relies on the following key novelties: (i) we use a wide and variable training set coming from multiple cohorts (ii) our training labels come in part from the output of the FreeSurfer algorithm, and (iii) we include synthetic data and use a powerful data augmentation scheme. Our method proves to be robust, and it has fast inference (<30s total per subject), with trained model available online (https://github.com/bthyreau/hippodeep). We depict illustrative results and show extensive qualitative and quantitative cohort-wide comparisons with FreeSurfer.

	abstract = {Automated analysis of MRI data of the subregions of the hippocampus requires computational atlases built at a higher resolution than those that are typically used in current neuroimaging studies. Here we describe the construction of a statistical atlas of the hippocampal formation at the subregion level using ultra-high resolution, ex vivo MRI. Fifteen autopsy samples were scanned at 0.13 mm isotropic resolution (on average) using customized hardware. The images were manually segmented into 13 different hippocampal substructures using a protocol specifically designed for this study; precise delineations were made possible by the extraordinary resolution of the scans. In addition to the subregions, manual annotations for neighboring structures (e.g., amygdala, cortex) were obtained from a separate dataset of in vivo, T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole brain (1mm resolution). The manual labels from the in vivo and ex vivo data were combined into a single computational atlas of the hippocampal formation with a novel atlas building algorithm based on Bayesian inference. The resulting atlas can be used to automatically segment the hippocampal subregions in structural MRI images, using an algorithm that can analyze multimodal data and adapt to variations in MRI contrast due to differences in acquisition hardware or pulse sequences. The applicability of the atlas, which we are releasing as part of FreeSurfer (version 6.0), is demonstrated with experiments on three different publicly available datasets with different types of MRI contrast. The results show that the atlas and companion segmentation method: 1) can segment T1 and T2 images, as well as their combination, 2) replicate findings on mild cognitive impairment based on high-resolution T2 data, and 3) can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease subjects and elderly controls with 88% accuracy in standard resolution (1mm) T1 data, significantly outperforming the atlas in FreeSurfer version 5.3 (86% accuracy) and classification based on whole hippocampal volume (82% accuracy).},

	abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	abstract = { Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools for quantifying neurostructural changes. Longitudinal-specific strategies for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power. Using the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) data, comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months, we evaluate the utility of longitudinal FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) surrogate thickness values in the context of a linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling strategy. Specifically, we estimate the residual variability and between-subject variability associated with each processing stream as it is known from the statistical literature that minimizing the former while simultaneously maximizing the latter leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams. Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed ANTs longitudinal framework which provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.},

The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters. These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Label fusion based multi-atlas segmentation has proven to be one of the most competitive techniques for medical image segmentation. This technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique, which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation: Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our techniques more accessible to the scientific research community, we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two datasets so far.},

	abstract = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called atlases, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using label fusion. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical image analysis that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules when using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN models such as VGG or U-Net architectures with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed AG models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including medical image classification and segmentation. For classification, we demonstrate the use case of AGs in scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. We show that the proposed attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall prediction performance by reducing false positives. For segmentation, the proposed architecture is evaluated on two large 3D CT abdominal datasets with manual annotations for multiple organs. Experimental results show that AG models consistently improve the prediction performance of the base architectures across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. Moreover, AGs guide the model activations to be focused around salient regions, which provides better insights into how model predictions are made. The source code for the proposed AG models is publicly available.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images.},

In this study, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network using 259 bilateral manually delineated segmentations collected from three studies, acquired at multiple sites on different scanners with variable protocols.

It was two orders of magnitude faster than some of the tested techniques. Further validation was performed on 200 subjects from two other disease populations (frontotemporal dementia and vascular cognitive impairment), highlighting our method's low outlier rate.

Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

LASHiS automatically segments hippocampus formation subfields by propagating labels from cross-sectionally labelled time point scans using joint-label fusion to a non-linearly realigned 'single subject template', where image segmentation occurs free of bias to any individual time point. Our pipeline measures tissue characteristics available in in vivo high-resolution MRI scans, at both clinical (3 ​T) and ultra-high field strength (7 ​T) and differs from previous longitudinal segmentation pipelines in that it leverages multi-contrast information in the segmentation process. LASHiS produces robust and reliable automatic multi-contrast segmentations of hippocampus formation subfields, as measured by higher volume similarity coefficients and Dice coefficients for test-retest reliability and robust longitudinal Bayesian Linear Mixed Effects results at 7 ​T, while showing sound results at 3 ​T. All code for this project including the automatic pipeline is available at https://github.com/CAIsr/LASHiS.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the earliest Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesion in the brain. Research suggests differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC (aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
Methods: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness measurements from serial magnetic resonance imaging scans of 775 ADNI-1 participants (219 healthy; 380 mild cognitive impairment; 176 AD) and use linear mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations among cortical thickness, disease status, and cognitive measures.
Results: Group status is reliably predicted by aLEC thickness, which also exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and tau levels.
Discussion: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity-it is a strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is among the earliest brain areas to deteriorate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent to which functional properties of the EC are altered in the aging brain, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, is not understood. Recent human fMRI studies have identified a functional dissociation within the EC, similar to what is found in rodents. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to identify a specific hypoactivity in the anterolateral EC (alEC) commensurate with major behavioral deficits on an object pattern separation task in asymptomatic older adults. Only subtle deficits were found in a comparable spatial condition, with no associated differences in posteromedial EC between young and older adults. We additionally linked this condition to dentate/CA3 hyperactivity, and the ratio of activity between the regions was associated with object mnemonic discrimination impairment. These results provide novel evidence of alEC-dentate/CA3 circuit dysfunction in cognitively normal aged humans.},

However, little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive function in older African Americans and how they relate to genetic risk for AD. In particular, no past study on African Americans has examined the effect of APOE ε4 status on pattern separation-mnemonic discrimination performance and its corresponding neural computations in the hippocampus. Previous work using the mnemonic discrimination paradigm has localized increased activation in the DG/CA3 hippocampal subregions as being correlated with discrimination deficits. In a case-control high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging study of 30 healthy African Americans, aged 60 years and older, we observed APOE ε4-related impairments in mnemonic discrimination, coincident with dysfunctional hyperactivation in the DG/CA3, and CA1 regions, despite no evidence of structural differences in the hippocampus between carriers and noncarriers. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that deficits in pattern separation may be an early marker for AD-related neuronal dysfunction.},

	abstract = {In animals, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with decreases in memory performance and hippocampal volume that may be prevented with agents that decrease glutamate release. Humans also demonstrate changes in memory and hippocampus with corticosteroids. In this report the effects of glutamate-release inhibitor lamotrigine on hippocampal structure and memory were examined in people receiving medically needed prescription corticosteroid therapy. A total of 54 outpatient adults (n = 28 women) receiving chronic (≥ 6 months) oral corticosteroid therapy were randomized to lamotrigine or placebo for 48 weeks. Declarative memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) focused on hippocampus were obtained at baseline and week 48. Utilizing a mixed-model approach, structural and biochemical data were examined by separate ANOVAs, and memory was assessed with a multi-level longitudinal model. RAVLT total scores demonstrated significantly better declarative memory performance with lamotrigine than placebo (p = 0.047). Hippocampal subfield volumes were not significantly different between the treatment groups. In summary, lamotrigine was associated with less decline in declarative memory performance than placebo in corticosteroid-treated patients. Findings suggest that, in humans as well as in animal models, glutamate release inhibitors may attenuate some of the effects on the human memory associated with corticosteroids.},

	abstract = {Preclinical and clinical research indicates that excess corticosteroid is associated with adverse effects on the hippocampus. Animal model data suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists may block corticosteroid effect on the hippocampus. This translational clinical trial investigated the effect of memantine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volume in humans receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Men and women (N = 46) receiving chronic prescription corticosteroid therapy were randomized to memantine or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design (two 24-week treatment periods, separated by a 4-week washout) for 52 weeks. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and after each treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean corticosteroid dose was 7.69 $\pm$ 6.41 mg/day and mean duration 4.90 $\pm$ 5.61 years. Controlling for baseline volumes, the left DG/CA3 region was significantly larger following memantine than placebo (p = .011). The findings suggest that an NMDA receptor antagonist attenuates corticosteroid effect in the same hippocampal subfields in humans as in animal models. This finding has both mechanistic and clinical implications. Attenuation of the effect of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 region implicates the NMDA receptor in human hippocampal volume losses with corticosteroids. In addition, by suggesting a drug class that may, at least in part, block the effects of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 subfield, these results may have clinical relevance for people receiving prescription corticosteroids, as well as to those with cortisol elevations due to medical or psychiatric conditions.},

@article{Nguyen:2019aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids are a class of hormones that include naturally occurring cortisol and corticosterone, as well as prescription drugs commonly used to manage inflammatory, autoimmune, and allergic conditions. Adverse effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, are common. The hippocampus appears to be especially sensitive to the effects of glucocorticoids. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined hippocampal subfields in humans receiving glucocorticoids. We examined patients on chronic glucocorticoid regimens to determine relationships between dose and duration of treatment, and hippocampal subfields, and related regions volumes.
METHODS/PROCEDURES: The study included adult men and women receiving at least 5 mg daily of prednisone equivalents for at least 6 months. Volumes of brain regions were measured via magnetic resonance imaging. A multivariate general linear model was used for analysis, with brain volumes as dependent variables and age, sex, and cumulative corticosteroid exposure, as predictors.
FINDINGS/RESULTS: The study population consisted of 81 adult outpatients (43 male) on corticosteroids (mean dose, 7.88 mg; mean duration, 76.75 months). Cumulative glucocorticoid exposure was negatively associated with left and right hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA3 volume. In subsequent subgroup analysis, this association held true for the age group older than the median age of 46 years but not for the younger age group.
IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: This finding is consistent with previous studies showing detrimental effects of elevated glucocorticoids on the hippocampus but further suggests that the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions are particularly vulnerable to those effects, which is consistent with animal models of chronic stress but has not been previously demonstrated in humans.},

	abstract = {This study examines neural mechanisms of negative overgeneralization, the increased likelihood of generalizing negative information, in peri-puberty. Theories suggest that weak pattern separation (overlapping representations are made distinct, indexed by DG/CA3 hippocampal subfield activation) underlies negative overgeneralization. We alternatively propose that neuro-maturational changes that favor pattern completion (cues reinstate stored representations, indexed by CA1 activation) are modulated by circuitry involved in emotional responding (amygdala, medial prefrontal cortices [mPFC]) to drive negative overgeneralization. Youth (N=34, 9-14 years) recruited from community and clinic settings participated in an emotional mnemonic similarity task while undergoing MRI. At Study, participants indicated the valence of images; at Test, participants made recognition memory judgments. Critical lure stimuli, that were similar to images at Study, were presented at Test, and errors ("false alarms") to negative relative to neutral stimuli reflected negative overgeneralization. Negative overgeneralization was related to greater and more similar patterns of activation in CA1 and both dorsal and ventral mPFC for negative relative to neutral stimuli. At Study, amygdala exhibited greater functional coupling with CA1 and dorsal mPFC during negative items that were later generalized. Negative overgeneralization is rooted in amygdala and mPFC modulation at encoding and pattern completion at retrieval.},

However, the hippocampus is not a uniform structure and has a number of subfields, the associations of which with age, sex, and polygenic risk score for AD (PRSAD) have been inadequately investigated. We examined these associations in 17,161 cognitively normal UK Biobank participants (44-80 years). Age was negatively associated with all the hippocampal subfield volumes and females had smaller volumes than men. Higher PRSAD was associated with lower volumes in the bilateral whole hippocampus, hippocampal-amygdala-transition-area, and hippocampal tail; right subiculum; left cornu ammonis 1, cornu ammonis 4, molecular layer, and granule cell layer of dentate gyrus. Older individuals (median age 63 years, n = 8984) showed greater subfield vulnerability to high PRSAD compared to the younger group (n = 8177), but the effect did not differ by sex. The pattern of subfield involvement in relation to the PRSAD in community dwelling healthy individuals sheds additional light on the pathogenesis of AD.},
