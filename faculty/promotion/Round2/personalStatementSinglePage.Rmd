# Personal Statement
_Nicholas J. Tustison, DSc_

<!--

As a scientist specializing in medical image analysis, my approach to research
and collaboration is guided by a deep commitment to the development of
high-quality, open-source computational strategies for biological and medical
imaging.  I believe that such commitments create a supportive and inclusive
environment where knowledge is shared, diverse perspectives are valued, and the
quality of work is held to the highest standards.  Their importance has only
increased since returning to the University of Virginia in 2010 as an Assistant
Professor and subsequently during my current tenure as an Associate Professor.

Throughout my academic career, I have benefited from caring mentors who have
promoted excellent academic scholarship and integrity while instilling values of
mutual respect.  As a prominent example, I continue to benefit immensely from
relationships developed during my initial post-graduate years at the PICSL lab,
particularly those at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Image and
Computing Science Laboratory under the direction of Dr. James C. Gee.  While at
the University of Pennsylvania, my colleague, Dr. Brian B. Avants, and I
co-founded the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).  This software package has
become one of the most widely used toolkits in the field for image data
processing and analysis which are described by some of the most highly cited
publications in the field.  Other packages, such as the well-known FreeSurfer
software package, have incorporated well-performing and complementary ANTs
components into their own libraries.  Recently, Dr. Gee and I have leveraged
this ANTs development in receiving two explicitly ANTs-related NIH R01 grants.

Given my role in the development of such widely used research tools, my focus
has provided significant opportunities for mentoring, teaching, and consulting
within the research community.  I have provided numerious tutorials and
workshops at various conferences and at different academic and scientific
institutions.  I have also organized this tutorial material for online access.
This has also resulted in an expansion of the circle of my collaborators beyond
the University of Virginia to include collaborations with people at such
academic entities and scientific institutions as the University of California,
Irvine, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Allen Brain Institute.  In addition,
given the credibility that the ANTs software has, I am often asked to provide
evaluative comparison data for international competitions and standardized
data for further processing of large-scale studies.

In parallel with the appreciation I have for my many external opportunities for
collaboration and mentoring, I am honored to be associated with the University
of Virginia and feel extremely fortunate to work with its high quality faculty
in exploring fascinating research questions.  I look forward to continuing my
academic career at UVa where I can best provide the necessary expertise for
medical imaging data science.
