{\Large \bf Research Statement}  

{\em Nicholas J. Tustison}
\end{center}

As research support faculty in the Department of Radiology and Medical
Imaging at UVa, my primary research focus is the development of robust
and accurate software for large-scale processing of medical imaging data
and corresponding analysis strategies for these data. To put it simply
and generally, I am a data scientist who operates at the nexus of ``big
data'', statistical science (including machine learning), and software
development for gaining insight into human systems.

\subsection{I. Principal Developer and Contributor of The Insight
Toolkit}\label{i.-principal-developer-and-contributor-of-the-insight-toolkit}

Addressing the deficiency of image processing tools for analyzing the
Visible Human Project in 1999, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the Insight Toolkit (ITK)
initiative bringing together multiple academic institutions and various
industrial partners, such as GE Research. This collaborative effort
resulted in the Insight Toolkit---a comprehensive, open-source suite of
implemented algorithms for medical image analysis. Development and
expansion continues to the present and is heavily utilized by industry
and academic groups worldwide and, due to its generalizability, has been
adopted by the French space agency (CNES) for the processing of
remote-sensing imagery.

\subsubsection{A. Major developer of NIH-sponsored open-source
software}\label{a.-major-developer-of-nih-sponsored-open-source-software}

I have provided several key developments to the Insight Toolkit. These
contributions are listed in the accompanying CV (Section IX, Subsection
C) \emph{Open-Source Software Short Communications}. Starting with my
first contribution in 2005 (\emph{\(N\)-D \(C^k\) B-Spline Scattered
Data Approximation}), I have continued to provide well-known,
open-source algorithmic implementations to the Insight Toolkit including
my latest contribution made recently on August 27, 2016 (\emph{Two Luis
Miguel fans walk into a bar in Nagoya ---\textgreater{} (yada, yada,
yada) ---\textgreater{} an ITK-implementation of a popular patch-based
denoising filter}). Other important contributions include operations for
image convolution (\emph{Image Kernel Convolution}), faux colormapping
(\emph{Meeting Andy Warhol Somewhere Over the Rainbow: RGB Colormapping
and ITK}), and fundamental measures for evaluating segmentation results
(\emph{Introducing Dice, Jaccard, and Other Label Overlap Measures To
ITK}). These software classes have been downloaded over 67,413 times
(average number of downloads per publication = 2,931).

\subsubsection{B. Inventor of the N4 method for MRI bias
correction}\label{b.-inventor-of-the-n4-method-for-mri-bias-correction}

Of all these contributions, perhaps my most significant is a method for
removing the low frequency inhomogeneity artifacts common to MR images
as an important preprocessing step for MR image analysis. This algorithm
is commonly referred to in the literature as ``N4'' or ``Nick's
nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization'' which was formally
introduced in the following publication:

\begin{quote}
Tustison NJ, Avants BB, Cook PA, Egan A, Zheng Y, Yushkevich PA, and Gee
JC. N4ITK: Improved N3 Bias Correction, \emph{IEEE Trans Med Imaging},
29(6):1310--1320, June 2010. Cited 367 times; IF = 3.390; Rank 5 out of
100 computer science, interdisciplinary applications, 12 out of 76
biomedical engineering, 18 out of 249 electrical \& electronic
engineering, 3 out of 24 imaging science \& photographic technology, 21
out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine \& medical imaging.\footnote{Included
  as a representative publication.}
\end{quote}

It is a significant extension of the popular N3 algorithm\footnote{Sled
  JG, Zijdenbos AP, and Evans AC. A nonparametric method for automatic
  correction of intensity nonuniformity in MRI data. \emph{IEEE Trans
  Med Imaging}, 17(1):87-97, Feb 1998.} (introduced in 1998 with
currently \textasciitilde{}3,000 citations). Prior to the N4 formal
publication, it was provided as open-source software to the ITK
community:

\begin{quote}

Field Correction, \emph{Insight Journal}, 2009,
\url{http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3053}.
\end{quote}

where it has been downloaded over 10,000 times.

\subsubsection{C. Co-investigator and principal developer of the ITKv4
image registration
refactoring}\label{c.-co-investigator-and-principal-developer-of-the-itkv4-image-registration-refactoring}

Image registration (or the mapping of corresponding features between two
images) is a fundamental component in medical image processing and
analysis. In 2011 the NIH-NLM sponsored a large-scale funding effort to
``modernize'' the Insight Toolkit. One of the three major contracts was
to provide modern image registration techniques to the toolkit requiring
a complete refactoring of the existing image registration framework.
This contract was awarded to a joint team consisting of myself and
collaborators from the University of Pennsylvania (under the direction
of Professor Jim Gee):

\begin{quote}
Sponsor: NIH-NLM\\
Title: \emph{Fundamental Refactoring of Deformable Image Registration in
ITK with Distributed Computing and GPU Acceleration}\\
Role: Principle investigator of UVa subcontract\\
Period: 7/1/2011 -- 6/30/2012
\end{quote}

This team provided several major image registration upgrades to the
algorithmic toolkit and I wrote a significant portion of the actual
software code. Not only did we implement current image registration
technologies for inclusion into the toolkit but we also were responsible
for new and innovative techniques:

\end{quote}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{D. Co-investigator and principal
developer of \emph{ITK-Lung: A Software Framework for Lung Image
Processing and
Analysis}}{D. Co-investigator and principal developer of ITK-Lung: A Software Framework for Lung Image Processing and Analysis}}\label{d.-co-investigator-and-principal-developer-of-itk-lung-a-software-framework-for-lung-image-processing-and-analysis}

Jim Gee and I recently submitted an NIH R01 grant for the development of
ITK-Lung, a set of open-source software tools for CT, PET, MRI pulmonary
image analysis based on the Insight ToolKit. Specifically, we plan to
provide core algorithms for specific pulmonary image analysis tasks
across multiple modalities, many of which I have implemented and made
available with previous publications. These basic tasks include intra-
and inter-modal pulmonary image registration, template building for
cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e., respiratory cycle) analyses,
functional and structural lung image segmentation, perfusion analysis,
and computation of quantitative image indices as potential imaging
biomarkers. These efforts would facilitate other NIH-sponsored projects
which interface specific pulmonary algorithms (e.g., CT nodule
detection) with clinical and research applications. Over the course of
this 5-year project, the following UVa faculty will be engaged:

\end{itemize}

\subsection{II. Co-Founder and Developer of the Advanced Normalization
Tools
(ANTs)}\label{ii.-co-founder-and-developer-of-the-advanced-normalization-tools-ants}

In 2006 my longtime colleague, Dr.~Brian Avants, and I co-founded the
Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). ANTs is popularly considered a
state-of-the-art medical image registration and segmentation toolkit
based on ITK. It is used by multiple academic institutions, research
facilities (e.g., the Allen Brain Institute, the Montreal Neurological
Institute, the Laboratory of Neuroimaging at the University of Southern
California), and industry leaders (e.g., IBM Watson, GE Research). In
addition to providing well-performing basic processing components, we
have also engineered advanced pipelines for obtaining key biomarkers for
specific applications. The major publication associated with this tool,

\begin{quote}
Avants BB, Tustison NJ, Song G, Cook PA, Klein A, and Gee JC. A
Reproducible Evaluation of ANTs Similarity Metric Performance in Brain
Image Registration, NeuroImage, 54(3):2033--2044, February 2011. Cited
448 times; IF = 6.357; Rank 1 out of 14 neuroimaging, 24 out of 252
neurosciences, 3 out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine \& medical
imaging.\footnote{Included as a representative publication.}
\end{quote}

is one of the most cited recent papers from the journal
\emph{NeuroImage}.

\subsubsection{A. The ANTs cortical thickness
pipeline}\label{a.-the-ants-cortical-thickness-pipeline}

Measuring the thickness of the cortical gray matter of the brain from
MRI has long been used for assessing various neuropathologies and normal
longitudinal changes in the brain. Up until recently the only publicly
available resource for performing this type of measurement was a
software program called ``FreeSurfer'' which is developed and made
available from Mass General Hospital of Harvard University. Recently,
however, I (along with several colleagues) created an ANTs-based
pipeline which outperformed FreeSurfer on multiple, publicly available
data sets. This work is described in

\begin{quote}
Tustison NJ, Cook PA, Klein A, Song G, Das SR, Duda JT, Kandel BM, van
Strien N, Stone JR, Gee JC, and Avants BB. Large-Scale Evaluation of
ANTs and FreeSurfer Cortical Thickness Measurements. \emph{NeuroImage},
99:166-179, Oct 2014. Cited 46 times; IF = 6.357; Rank 1 out of 14
neuroimaging, 24 out of 252 neurosciences, 3 out of 125 radiology,
nuclear medicine \& medical imaging.
\end{quote}

and is currently being employed by multiple groups and several
institutions. All resulting quantities and corresponding scripts and
analyses have been made publicly available for external use. In fact,
these measurements were used recently for investigating other hypotheses
concerning the longitudinal development of the entorhinal cortex:

\begin{quote}

Savatic M, and Soares J. Entorhinal cortex thickness across the human
lifespan. J of Neuroimaging, 26(3) :278-82, May 2016. Cited 0 times; IF
= 1.734; Rank 128 out of 192 clinical neurology, 12 out of 14
neuroimaging, and 65 out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine \& medical
imaging.\footnote{Included as a representative publication.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{B. Participant in international medical image analysis
competitions}\label{b.-participant-in-international-medical-image-analysis-competitions}

Over the years our ANTs-based tools have won several international
competitions for a wide variety of applications involving several key
UVa collaborators:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  finished in the first rank in the Klein 2009 international brain
  mapping competition,\footnote{Klein et al., Evaluation of 14 nonlinear
    deformation algorithms applied to human brain MRI registration.
    \emph{NeuroImage}, 46(3):786-802, Jul 2009.}
\item
  finished first overall in the EMPIRE10 international lung mapping
  competition,\footnote{Murphy et al., Evaluation of registration
    methods on thoracic CT: the EMPIRE10 challenge. \emph{IEEE Trans Med
    Imaging}, 30(11):1901-20, Nov 2011.}
\item
  was the standard registration tool for the MICCAI 2013 segmentation
  competitions,\footnote{\url{http://www.miccai2013.org}}
\item
  finished first in the BRATS 2013 challenge,\footnote{\url{http://martinos.org/qtim/miccai2013/}}
  and
\item
  won the best paper award at the STACOM 2014 challenge.\footnote{\url{http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319146775}}
\end{itemize}

We have provided these winning protocols to the public as open-source
for continued development.

\subsubsection{C. Educator via tutorials and other ANTs informational
fora}\label{c.-educator-via-tutorials-and-other-ants-informational-fora}

I have given several workshops to disseminate a better hands-on
knowledge of the various algorithms and pipelines of the ANTs and ITK
toolkits. These include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ANTs workshop, MD Anderson, Houston, TX, USA. August 2016.
\item
  ANTs Workshop for the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium
  (CENC), Baylor College, Houston, TX, USA. October 2015.
\item
  SimpleITK tutorial, MICCAI, Munich, Germany. October 2015.
\item
  ANTs workshop, Laboratory of Neuroimaging, Marina Del Rey, USA. July
  2015.
\item
  CREATE-MIA Summer Workshop, ANTs Workshop, Montreal, Canada. May 2015.
\item
  SPIE Medical Imaging Workshop, Open source tools for medical image
  analysis, San Diego, USA. February 2012.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these workshops, I respond to several ANTs queries per
week originating from our Sourceforge or Github ANTs repositories. These
inquiries range from instructions for specific programs to providing
analysis guidelines for large-scale studies.

\subsubsection{D. Developer for the ANTsR
project}\label{d.-developer-for-the-antsr-project}

ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools) is designed to provide high
performance image processing techniques for medical image analysis.
During the evolution of the toolkit, it became clear that robust
statistical machinery was lacking for making inferences from data
produced from ANTs processing and visualization. As part of a
collaborative effort, I am part of the ANTsR development team which
provides an interface between ANTs and the R project for statistical
computing and visualization thus providing a complete set of tools for
multivariate image analysis. ANTsR intends to provide a modern framework
for medical analytics, with a focus on imaging-assisted prediction and
statistical power. The ANTsR package is publicly available on the github
project hosting service

\subsection{III. Research Support}\label{iii.-research-support}

As research faculty, I have played a supportive role for the various
faculty research efforts. These include the following (with
corresponding publications and other items of note):

\subsubsection{A. UVa collaborations}\label{a.-uva-collaborations}

    ANTs image registration techniques are currently used as part of
    Mike Salerno's (Cardiac, Radiology \& Medical Imaging, and
    Biomedical Engineering Departments) ongoing development of novel
    cardiac MRI acquisition techniques. As part of this collaborative
    work, Mike and I won the best paper award at the Statistical Atlases
    and Computational Modelling of the Heart (STACOM) motion estimation
    challenge held in Boston, 2014 as part of the international Medical
    Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
    conference.

    Recently, Tony Filiano and Jonathon Kipnis of the Neuroscience
    Department of UVa published a breakthrough paper in Nature
    concerning the relationship between immunity and social deficits. I
    was instrumental in that publication in performing the resting state
    fMRI analysis using some of the software I developed within the
    ANTsR package:
